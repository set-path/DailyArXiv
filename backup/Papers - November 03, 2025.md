| **[Improving Visual Discriminability of CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23894v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14), partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 10 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Spatial Reasoning in Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15841v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg) to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL) formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally, these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters, validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lost in Translation? Vocabulary Alignment for Source-Free Adaptation in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15225v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce VocAlign, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework specifically designed for VLMs in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Our method adopts a student-teacher paradigm enhanced with a vocabulary alignment strategy, which improves pseudo-label generation by incorporating additional class concepts. To ensure efficiency, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model, preserving its original capabilities while minimizing computational overhead. In addition, we propose a Top-K class selection mechanism for the student model, which significantly reduces memory requirements while further improving adaptation performance. Our approach achieves a notable 6.11 mIoU improvement on the CityScapes dataset and demonstrates superior performance on zero-shot segmentation benchmarks, setting a new standard for source-free adaptation in the open-vocabulary setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>BMVC ...</summary><p>BMVC 2025 - Project Page: https://thegoodailab.org/blog/vocalign - Code: https://github.com/Sisso16/VocAlign</p></details> |
| **[OpenUrban3D: Annotation-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale Urban Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10842v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation enables models to recognize and segment objects from arbitrary natural language descriptions, offering the flexibility to handle novel, fine-grained, or functionally defined categories beyond fixed label sets. While this capability is crucial for large-scale urban point clouds that support applications such as digital twins, smart city management, and urban analytics, it remains largely unexplored in this domain. The main obstacles are the frequent absence of high-quality, well-aligned multi-view imagery in large-scale urban point cloud datasets and the poor generalization of existing three-dimensional (3D) segmentation pipelines across diverse urban environments with substantial variation in geometry, scale, and appearance. To address these challenges, we present OpenUrban3D, the first 3D open-vocabulary semantic segmentation framework for large-scale urban scenes that operates without aligned multi-view images, pre-trained point cloud segmentation networks, or manual annotations. Our approach generates robust semantic features directly from raw point clouds through multi-view, multi-granularity rendering, mask-level vision-language feature extraction, and sample-balanced fusion, followed by distillation into a 3D backbone model. This design enables zero-shot segmentation for arbitrary text queries while capturing both semantic richness and geometric priors. Extensive experiments on large-scale urban benchmarks, including SensatUrban and SUM, show that OpenUrban3D achieves significant improvements in both segmentation accuracy and cross-scene generalization over existing methods, demonstrating its potential as a flexible and scalable solution for 3D urban scene understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Novel Category Discovery with X-Agent Attention for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01275v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge, existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored, making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent, an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2025</p></details> |
| **[DGL-RSIS: Decoupling Global Spatial Context and Local Class Semantics for Training-Free Remote Sensing Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00598v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD) module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS), under review</p></details> |
| **[Annotation-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation for Remote-Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18067v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp, a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images, where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and open-world Earth observation.</p></details> | <details><summary>All c...</summary><p>All codes and models will be released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-OV-2</p></details> |
| **[CitySeg: A 3D Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation Foundation Model in City-scale Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09470v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification of 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive 3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual information.</p></details> |  |
| **[SynSeg: Feature Synergy for Multi-Category Contrastive Learning in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06115v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories. Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS). Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance, SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Free Class Purification for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00557v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However, the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS. Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance. However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity. The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP, as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when combined with other OVSS methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[OpenSeg-R: Improving Open-Vocabulary Segmentation via Step-by-Step Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16974v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) has drawn increasing attention for its capacity to generalize segmentation beyond predefined categories. However, existing methods typically predict segmentation masks with simple forward inference, lacking explicit reasoning and interpretability. This makes it challenging for OVS model to distinguish similar categories in open-world settings due to the lack of contextual understanding and discriminative visual cues. To address this limitation, we propose a step-by-step visual reasoning framework for open-vocabulary segmentation, named OpenSeg-R. The proposed OpenSeg-R leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to perform hierarchical visual reasoning before segmentation. Specifically, we generate both generic and image-specific reasoning for each image, forming structured triplets that explain the visual reason for objects in a coarse-to-fine manner. Based on these reasoning steps, we can compose detailed description prompts, and feed them to the segmentor to produce more accurate segmentation masks. To the best of our knowledge, OpenSeg-R is the first framework to introduce explicit step-by-step visual reasoning into OVS. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenSeg-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across five benchmark datasets. Moreover, it achieves consistent gains across all metrics on open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Qualitative results further highlight the effectiveness of our reasoning-guided framework in improving both segmentation precision and interpretability. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Hanzy1996/OpenSeg-R.</p></details> |  |
| **[CorrCLIP: Reconstructing Patch Correlations in CLIP for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10086v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to each pixel without being constrained by a predefined set of categories. While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in zero-shot classification, it struggles to align image patches with category embeddings because of its incoherent patch correlations. This study reveals that inter-class correlations are the main reason for impairing CLIP's segmentation performance. Accordingly, we propose CorrCLIP, which reconstructs the scope and value of patch correlations. Specifically, CorrCLIP leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to define the scope of patch interactions, reducing inter-class correlations. To mitigate the problem that SAM-generated masks may contain patches belonging to different classes, CorrCLIP incorporates self-supervised models to compute coherent similarity values, suppressing the weight of inter-class correlations. Additionally, we introduce two additional branches to strengthen patch features' spatial details and semantic representation. Finally, we update segmentation maps with SAM-generated masks to improve spatial consistency. Based on the improvement across patch correlations, feature representations, and segmentation maps, CorrCLIP achieves superior performance across eight benchmarks. Codes are available at: https://github.com/zdk258/CorrCLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 Oral</p></details> |
| **[FLOSS: Free Lunch in Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10487v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we challenge the conventional practice in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) of using averaged class-wise text embeddings, which are typically obtained by encoding each class name with multiple templates (e.g., a photo of <class>, a sketch of a <class>). We investigate the impact of templates for OVSS, and find that for each class, there exist single-template classifiers--which we refer to as class-experts--that significantly outperform the conventional averaged classifier. First, to identify these class-experts, we introduce a novel approach that estimates them without any labeled data or training. By leveraging the class-wise prediction entropy of single-template classifiers, we select those yielding the lowest entropy as the most reliable class-experts. Second, we combine the outputs of class-experts in a new fusion process. Our plug-and-play method, coined FLOSS, is orthogonal and complementary to existing OVSS methods, offering an improvement without the need for additional labels or training. Extensive experiments show that FLOSS consistently enhances state-of-the-art OVSS models, generalizes well across datasets with different distribution shifts, and delivers substantial improvements in low-data scenarios where only a few unlabeled images are available. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/FLOSS .</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025; Project Page: https://yasserben.github.io/FLOSS/</p></details> |
| **[FA-Seg: A Fast and Accurate Diffusion-Based Method for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23323v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets. Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the computation costs and the quality of the segmentation mask. In this work, we present FA-Seg, a Fast and Accurate training-free framework for open-vocabulary segmentation based on diffusion models. FA-Seg performs segmentation using only a (1+1)-step from a pretrained diffusion model. Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FA-Seg performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the segmentation quality, FA-Seg introduces three key components: (i) a dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction, (ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances semantic precision via multi-resolution attention fusion, and (iii) a Test-Time Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive experiments show that FA-Seg achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that FA-Seg provides a strong foundation for extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference efficiency. The source code will be open-sourced after this paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized OVSS: Understanding Personal Concept in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11030v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) can segment an image into semantic regions based on arbitrarily given text descriptions even for classes unseen during training, it fails to understand personal texts (e.g., `my mug cup') for segmenting regions of specific interest to users. This paper addresses challenges like recognizing `my mug cup' among `multiple mug cups'. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel task termed \textit{personalized open-vocabulary semantic segmentation} and propose a text prompt tuning-based plug-in method designed to recognize personal visual concepts using a few pairs of images and masks, while maintaining the performance of the original OVSS. Based on the observation that reducing false predictions is essential when applying text prompt tuning to this task, our proposed method employs `negative mask proposal' that captures visual concepts other than the personalized concept. We further improve the performance by enriching the representation of text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of the personal concept into them. This approach enhances personalized OVSS without compromising the original OVSS performance. We demonstrate the superiority of our method on our newly established benchmarks for this task, including FSS$^\text{per}$, CUB$^\text{per}$, and ADE$^\text{per}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025; 15 pages</p></details> |
| **[Beyond-Labels: Advancing Open-Vocabulary Segmentation With Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16769v5)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation attempts to classify and outline objects in an image using arbitrary text labels, including those unseen during training. Self-supervised learning resolves numerous visual and linguistic processing problems when effectively trained. This study investigates simple yet efficient methods for adapting previously learned foundation models for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks. Our research proposes "Beyond-Labels", a lightweight transformer-based fusion module that uses a small amount of image segmentation data to fuse frozen visual representations with language concepts. This strategy allows the model to leverage the extensive knowledge of pre-trained models without requiring significant retraining, making the approach data-efficient and scalable. Furthermore, we capture positional information in images using Fourier embeddings, improving generalization and enabling smooth and consistent spatial encoding. We perform thorough ablation studies to examine the main components of our proposed method. On the standard benchmark PASCAL-5i, the method performs better despite being trained on frozen vision and language representations.

| **[RadZero: Similarity-Based Cross-Attention for Explainable Vision-Language Alignment in Radiology with Zero-Shot Multi-Task Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07416v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multi-modal models have significantly improved vision-language (VL) alignment in radiology. However, existing approaches struggle to effectively utilize complex radiology reports for learning and offer limited interpretability through attention probability visualizations. To address these challenges, we introduce RadZero, a novel framework for VL alignment in radiology with zero-shot multi-task capability. A key component of our approach is VL-CABS (Vision-Language Cross-Attention Based on Similarity), which aligns text embeddings with local image features for interpretable, fine-grained VL reasoning. RadZero leverages large language models to extract concise semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs multi-positive contrastive training to effectively capture relationships between images and multiple relevant textual descriptions. It uses a pre-trained vision encoder with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text embeddings and local image patch features, VL-CABS enables zero-shot inference with similarity probability for classification, and pixel-level VL similarity maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, VL similarity map analysis highlights the potential of VL-CABS for improving explainability in VL alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Image Augmentation for Semantic Segmentation in Outdoor Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00153v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of leaning-based perception algorithms suffer when deployed in out-of-distribution and underrepresented environments. Outdoor robots are particularly susceptible to rapid changes in visual scene appearance due to dynamic lighting, seasonality and weather effects that lead to scenes underrepresented in the training data of the learning-based perception system. In this conceptual paper, we focus on preparing our autonomous vehicle for deployment in snow-filled environments. We propose a novel method for diffusion-based image augmentation to more closely represent the deployment environment in our training data. Diffusion-based image augmentations rely on the public availability of vision foundation models learned on internet-scale datasets. The diffusion-based image augmentations allow us to take control over the semantic distribution of the ground surfaces in the training data and to fine-tune our model for its deployment environment. We employ open vocabulary semantic segmentation models to filter out augmentation candidates that contain hallucinations. We believe that diffusion-based image augmentations can be extended to many other environments apart from snow surfaces, like sandy environments and volcanic terrains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing the Multi-View Fusion Potential: Noise Correction in VLM for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22817v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding approaches mainly focus on training 3D networks through contrastive learning with point-text pairs or by distilling 2D features into 3D models via point-pixel alignment. While these methods show considerable performance in benchmarks with limited vocabularies, they struggle to handle diverse object categories as the limited amount of 3D data upbound training strong open-vocabulary 3d models. We observe that 2D multi-view fusion methods take precedence in understanding diverse concepts in 3D scenes. However, inherent noises in vision-language models lead multi-view fusion to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we introduce MVOV3D, a novel approach aimed at unleashing the potential of 2D multi-view fusion for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. We focus on reducing the inherent noises without training, thereby preserving the generalizability while enhancing open-world capabilities. Specifically, MVOV3D improves multi-view 2D features by leveraging precise region-level image features and text features encoded by CLIP encoders and incorporates 3D geometric priors to optimize multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, our MVOV3D achieves a new record with 14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160 for challenge open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, outperforming current leading trained 3D networks by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReME: A Data-Centric Framework for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21233v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets. In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing OVS without training.

| **[LPOSS: Label Propagation Over Patches and Pixels for Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19777v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a training-free method for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation using Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs). Our approach enhances the initial per-patch predictions of VLMs through label propagation, which jointly optimizes predictions by incorporating patch-to-patch relationships. Since VLMs are primarily optimized for cross-modal alignment and not for intra-modal similarity, we use a Vision Model (VM) that is observed to better capture these relationships. We address resolution limitations inherent to patch-based encoders by applying label propagation at the pixel level as a refinement step, significantly improving segmentation accuracy near class boundaries. Our method, called LPOSS+, performs inference over the entire image, avoiding window-based processing and thereby capturing contextual interactions across the full image. LPOSS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods, across a diverse set of datasets. Code: https://github.com/vladan-stojnic/LPOSS</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Depth and Language for Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09881v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and domain generalization in semantic segmentation (DGSS) highlight a subtle complementarity that motivates Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS). OV-DGSS aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while maintaining robustness across unseen domains, a critical capability for real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We introduce Vireo, a novel single-stage framework for OV-DGSS that unifies the strengths of OVSS and DGSS for the first time. Vireo builds upon the frozen Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) and incorporates scene geometry via Depth VFMs to extract domain-invariant structural features. To bridge the gap between visual and textual modalities under domain shift, we propose three key components: (1) GeoText Prompts, which align geometric features with language cues and progressively refine VFM encoder representations; (2) Coarse Mask Prior Embedding (CMPE) for enhancing gradient flow for faster convergence and stronger textual influence; and (3) the Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding Head (DOV-VEH), which fuses refined structural and semantic features for robust prediction. Comprehensive evaluation on these components demonstrates the effectiveness of our designs. Our proposed Vireo achieves the state-of-the-art performance and surpasses existing methods by a large margin in both domain generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, offering a unified and scalable solution for robust visual understanding in diverse and dynamic environments.

Given an arbitrary set of textual queries, image pixels are assigned the closest query in feature space. However, this works well when a user exhaustively lists all possible visual concepts in an image that contrast against each other for the assignment. This corresponds to the current evaluation setup in the literature, which relies on having access to a list of in-domain relevant concepts, typically classes of a benchmark dataset. Here, we consider the more challenging (and realistic) scenario of segmenting a single concept, given a textual prompt and nothing else. To achieve good results, besides contrasting with the generic 'background' text, we propose two different approaches to automatically generate, at test time, query-specific textual contrastive concepts. We do so by leveraging the distribution of text in the VLM's training set or crafted LLM prompts. We also propose a metric designed to evaluate this scenario and show the relevance of our approach on commonly used datasets.</p></details> | TMLR camera-ready |

To enhance out-of-domain generalization, we propose Cost Aggregation with Optimal Transport (OV-COAST) for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To align visual-language features within the framework of optimal transport theory, we employ cost volume to construct a cost matrix, which quantifies the distance between two distributions. Our approach adopts a two-stage optimization strategy: in the first stage, the optimal transport problem is solved using cost volume via Sinkhorn distance to obtain an alignment solution; in the second stage, this solution is used to guide the training of the CAT-Seg model. We evaluate state-of-the-art OVSS models on the MESS benchmark, where our approach notably improves the performance of the cost-aggregation model CAT-Seg with ViT-B backbone, achieving superior results, surpassing CAT-Seg by 1.72 % and SAN-B by 4.9 % mIoU.

Traditional methods strive to train models up from scratch, requiring vast amounts of computational resources and training data. In the advent of moving to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which asks models to classify beyond learned categories, large quantities of finely annotated data would be prohibitively expensive. Researchers have instead turned to training-free methods where they leverage existing models made for tasks where data is more easily acquired. Specifically, this survey will cover the history, nuance, idea development and the state-of-the-art in training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation that leverages existing multi-modal classification models. We will first give a preliminary on the task definition followed by an overview of popular model archetypes and then spotlight over 30 approaches split into broader research branches: purely CLIP-based, those leveraging auxiliary visual foundation models and ones relying on generative methods. Subsequently, we will discuss the limitations and potential problems of current research, as well as provide some underexplored ideas for future study. We believe this survey will serve as a good onboarding read to new researchers and spark increased interest in the area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21844v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, test-time adaptation has attracted wide interest in the context of vision-language models for image classification. However, to the best of our knowledge, the problem is completely overlooked in dense prediction tasks such as Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS). In response, we propose a novel TTA method tailored to adapting VLMs for segmentation during test time. Unlike TTA methods for image classification, our Multi-Level and Multi-Prompt (MLMP) entropy minimization integrates features from intermediate vision-encoder layers and is performed with different text-prompt templates at both the global CLS token and local pixel-wise levels. Our approach could be used as plug-and-play for any segmentation network, does not require additional training data or labels, and remains effective even with a single test sample. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive OVSS TTA benchmark suite, which integrates a rigorous evaluation protocol, seven segmentation datasets, and 15 common corruptions, with a total of 82 distinct test scenarios, establishing a standardized and comprehensive testbed for future TTA research in open-vocabulary segmentation. Our experiments on this suite demonstrate that our segmentation-tailored method consistently delivers significant gains over direct adoption of TTA classification baselines.</p></details> |  |

Current methods utilize text embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP but struggle with the inherent domain gap between image and text embeddings, even after extensive alignment during training. Additionally, relying solely on deep text-aligned features limits shallow-level feature guidance, which is crucial for detecting small objects and fine details, ultimately reducing segmentation accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a dual prompting framework, DPSeg, for this task. Our approach combines dual-prompt cost volume generation, a cost volume-guided decoder, and a semantic-guided prompt refinement strategy that leverages our dual prompting scheme to mitigate alignment issues in visual prompt generation. By incorporating visual embeddings from a visual prompt encoder, our approach reduces the domain gap between text and image embeddings while providing multi-level guidance through shallow features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on multiple public datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

However, current multi-modal scene understanding approaches have naively embedded semantic representations into 3D reconstruction methods without striking a balance between visual and language modalities, which leads to unsatisfying semantic rasterization of translucent or reflective objects, as well as over-fitting on color modality. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a solution that adequately handles the distinct visual and semantic modalities, i.e., a 3D vision-language Gaussian splatting model for scene understanding, to put emphasis on the representation learning of language modality. We propose a novel cross-modal rasterizer, using modality fusion along with a smoothed semantic indicator for enhancing semantic rasterization. We also employ a camera-view blending technique to improve semantic consistency between existing and synthesized views, thereby effectively mitigating over-fitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

These foundational models, especially CLIP, have accelerated research in open-vocabulary computer vision tasks, including Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS). Although the initial results are promising, the dense prediction capabilities of VLMs still require further improvement. In this study, we enhance the semantic segmentation performance of CLIP by introducing new modules and modifications: 1) architectural changes in the last layer of ViT and the incorporation of attention maps from the middle layers with the last layer, 2) Image Engineering: applying data augmentations to enrich input image representations, and 3) using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate definitions and synonyms for each class name to leverage CLIP's open-vocabulary capabilities. Our training-free method, ITACLIP, outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on segmentation benchmarks such as COCO-Stuff, COCO-Object, Pascal Context, and Pascal VOC.

However, most existing works over-trusted SAM to regularize image-level CLIP without any further refinement. Moreover, several existing works improved efficiency by dimensionality reduction of semantic features from 2D VLMs before fusing with 3DGS semantic fields, which inevitably leads to multi-view inconsistency. In this work, we propose econSG for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with 3DGS. Our econSG consists of: 1) A Confidence-region Guided Regularization (CRR) that mutually refines SAM and CLIP to get the best of both worlds for precise semantic features with complete and precise boundaries. 2) A low dimensional contextual space to enforce 3D multi-view consistency while improving computational efficiency by fusing backprojected multi-view 2D features and follow by dimensional reduction directly on the fused 3D features instead of operating on each 2D view separately. Our econSG shows state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets compared to the existing methods. Furthermore, we are also the most efficient training among all the methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Spectral Graph for Object-Context Aware Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17150v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) has advanced with recent vision-language models (VLMs), enabling segmentation beyond predefined categories through various learning schemes. Notably, training-free methods offer scalable, easily deployable solutions for handling unseen data, a key goal of OVSS. Yet, a critical issue persists: lack of object-level context consideration when segmenting complex objects in the challenging environment of OVSS based on arbitrary query prompts. This oversight limits models' ability to group semantically consistent elements within object and map them precisely to user-defined arbitrary classes. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes this limitation by incorporating object-level contextual knowledge within images. Specifically, our model enhances intra-object consistency by distilling spectral-driven features from vision foundation models into the attention mechanism of the visual encoder, enabling semantically coherent components to form a single object mask. Additionally, we refine the text embeddings with zero-shot object presence likelihood to ensure accurate alignment with the specific objects represented in the images. By leveraging object-level contextual knowledge, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalizability across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods address this by sequentially connecting a powerful mask proposal generator, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP. But these two-stage approaches often suffer from high computational costs, memory inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose ESC-Net, a novel one-stage open-vocabulary segmentation model that leverages the SAM decoder blocks for class-agnostic segmentation within an efficient inference framework. By embedding pseudo prompts generated from image-text correlations into SAM's promptable segmentation framework, ESC-Net achieves refined spatial aggregation for accurate mask predictions. ESC-Net achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks, including ADE20K, PASCAL-VOC, and PASCAL-Context, outperforming prior methods in both efficiency and accuracy.

Autonomous assistive robots, such as smart wheelchairs, require robust capabilities in spatial segmentation and semantic recognition to navigate complex built environments effectively. Place segmentation involves delineating spatial regions like rooms or functional areas, while semantic recognition assigns semantic labels to these regions, enabling accurate localization to user-specific needs. Existing approaches often utilize deep learning; however, these close-vocabulary detection systems struggle to interpret intuitive and casual human instructions. Additionally, most existing methods ignore the uncertainty of the scene recognition problem, leading to low success rates, particularly in ambiguous and complex environments. To address these challenges, we propose an open-vocabulary scene semantic segmentation and detection pipeline leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach follows a 'Segment Detect Select' framework for open-vocabulary scene classification, enabling adaptive and intuitive navigation for assistive robots in built environments.</p></details> | 32 pages, 7 figures |

However, large shifts between training and test domains degrade their performance, requiring fine-tuning for effective real-world applications. We introduce Semantic Library Adaptation (SemLA), a novel framework for training-free, test-time domain adaptation. SemLA leverages a library of LoRA-based adapters indexed with CLIP embeddings, dynamically merging the most relevant adapters based on proximity to the target domain in the embedding space. This approach constructs an ad-hoc model tailored to each specific input without additional training. Our method scales efficiently, enhances explainability by tracking adapter contributions, and inherently protects data privacy, making it ideal for sensitive applications. Comprehensive experiments on a 20-domain benchmark built over 10 standard datasets demonstrate SemLA's superior adaptability and performance across diverse settings, establishing a new standard in domain adaptation for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Rethinking the Global Knowledge of CLIP in Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06818v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works modify CLIP to perform open-vocabulary semantic segmentation in a training-free manner (TF-OVSS). In vanilla CLIP, patch-wise image representations mainly encode homogeneous image-level properties, which hinders the application of CLIP to the dense prediction task. Previous TF-OVSS works sacrifice globality to enhance the locality of CLIP features, by making each patch mainly attend to itself or its neighboring patches within a narrow local window. With their modifications,the ability of CLIP to aggregate global context information is largely weakened. Differently, in this paper, we rethink the global knowledge encoded by CLIP and propose GCLIP to answer how to extract and utilize beneficial global knowledge of CLIP for TF-OVSS. As the representation of each patch is finally determined by the attention weights and the Value embeddings, we propose to reshape the last-block attention and Value embeddings to aggregate useful global context into final features. Firstly, we aim to equip the last-block attention with image-level properties while not introducing homogeneous attention patterns across patches. To realize the goal, we fuse the attention from the global-token emerging blocks with the Query-Query attention. Secondly, we aim to make Value embeddings of the last-block attention module more semantically correlated. To realize this, we design a novel channel suppression strategy.Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | Under review |

While current open-vocabulary approaches show impressive performance on standard segmentation benchmarks under zero-shot settings, they fall short of supervised counterparts on highly domain-specific datasets. We focus on segmentation-specific test-time optimization to address this gap. Segmentation requires an understanding of multiple concepts within a single image while retaining the locality and spatial structure of representations. We propose a novel self-supervised objective adhering to these requirements and use it to align the model parameters with input images at test time. In the textual modality, we learn multiple embeddings for each category to capture diverse concepts within an image, while in the visual modality, we calculate pixel-level losses followed by embedding aggregation operations specific to preserving spatial structure. Our resulting framework termed Seg-TTO is a plug-and-play module. We integrate Seg-TTO with three state-of-the-art OVSS approaches and evaluate across 22 challenging OVSS tasks covering a range of specialized domains. Our Seg-TTO demonstrates clear performance improvements (up to 27% mIoU increase on some datasets) establishing new state-of-the-art. Our code and models will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

While this flexibility represents a significant advancement, current approaches still rely on manually specified class names as input, creating an inherent bottleneck in real-world applications. This work proposes a Vocabulary-Free Semantic Segmentation pipeline, eliminating the need for predefined class vocabularies. Specifically, we address the chicken-and-egg problem where users need knowledge of all potential objects within a scene to identify them, yet the purpose of segmentation is often to discover these objects. The proposed approach leverages Vision-Language Models to automatically recognize objects and generate appropriate class names, aiming to solve the challenge of class specification and naming quality. Through extensive experiments on several public datasets, we highlight the crucial role of the text encoder in model performance, particularly when the image text classes are paired with generated descriptions. Despite the challenges introduced by the sensitivity of the segmentation text encoder to false negatives within the class tagging process, which adds complexity to the task, we demonstrate that our fully automated pipeline significantly enhances vocabulary-free segmentation accuracy across diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to: Pattern Recognition Letters, Klara Reichard and Giulia Rizzoli equally contributed to this work</p></details> |

Recent advancements in large-scale vision-language models have demonstrated their open-vocabulary understanding capabilities, significantly facilitating the development of OVSS. However, most existing methods suffer from either suboptimal performance or long latency. This study introduces ERR-Seg, a novel framework that effectively reduces redundancy to balance accuracy and efficiency. ERR-Seg incorporates a training-free Channel Reduction Module (CRM) that leverages prior knowledge from vision-language models like CLIP to identify the most relevant classes while discarding others. Moreover, it incorporates Efficient Semantic Context Fusion (ESCF) with spatial-level and class-level sequence reduction strategies. CRM and ESCF result in substantial memory and computational savings without compromising accuracy. Additionally, recognizing the significance of hierarchical semantics extracted from middle-layer features for closed-set semantic segmentation, ERR-Seg introduces the Hierarchical Semantic Module (HSM) to exploit hierarchical semantics in the context of OVSS. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods under the ADE20K-847 setting, ERR-Seg achieves +$5.6\%$ mIoU improvement and reduces latency by $67.3\%$.</p></details> |  |
| **[InvSeg: Test-Time Prompt Inversion for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11473v2)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-textual correlations in the attention maps derived from text-to-image diffusion models are proven beneficial to dense visual prediction tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation. However, a significant challenge arises due to the input distributional discrepancy between the context-rich sentences used for image generation and the isolated class names typically used in semantic segmentation. This discrepancy hinders diffusion models from capturing accurate visual-textual correlations. To solve this, we propose InvSeg, a test-time prompt inversion method that tackles open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by inverting image-specific visual context into text prompt embedding space, leveraging structure information derived from the diffusion model's reconstruction process to enrich text prompts so as to associate each class with a structure-consistent mask. Specifically, we introduce Contrastive Soft Clustering (CSC) to align derived masks with the image's structure information, softly selecting anchors for each class and calculating weighted distances to push inner-class pixels closer while separating inter-class pixels, thereby ensuring mask distinction and internal consistency. By incorporating sample-specific context, InvSeg learns context-rich text prompts in embedding space and achieves accurate semantic alignment across modalities. Experiments show that InvSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context and COCO Object datasets.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[FGAseg: Fine-Grained Pixel-Text Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00877v2)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary segmentation aims to identify and segment specific regions and objects based on text-based descriptions. A common solution is to leverage powerful vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to bridge the gap between vision and text information. However, VLMs are typically pretrained for image-level vision-text alignment, focusing on global semantic features. In contrast, segmentation tasks require fine-grained pixel-level alignment and detailed category boundary information, which VLMs alone cannot provide. As a result, information extracted directly from VLMs can't meet the requirements of segmentation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose FGAseg, a model designed for fine-grained pixel-text alignment and category boundary supplementation. The core of FGAseg is a Pixel-Level Alignment module that employs a cross-modal attention mechanism and a text-pixel alignment loss to refine the coarse-grained alignment from CLIP, achieving finer-grained pixel-text semantic alignment. Additionally, to enrich category boundary information, we introduce the alignment matrices as optimizable pseudo-masks during forward propagation and propose Category Information Supplementation module. These pseudo-masks, derived from cosine and convolutional similarity, provide essential global and local boundary information between different categories. By combining these two strategies, FGAseg effectively enhances pixel-level alignment and category boundary information, addressing key challenges in open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FGAseg outperforms existing methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods mostly lift knowledge from large 2D vision models into 3DGS on a scene-by-scene basis, restricting the capabilities of open-vocabulary querying within their training scenes so that lacking the generalizability to novel scenes. In this work, we propose \textbf{OVGaussian}, a generalizable \textbf{O}pen-\textbf{V}ocabulary 3D semantic segmentation framework based on the 3D \textbf{Gaussian} representation. We first construct a large-scale 3D scene dataset based on 3DGS, dubbed \textbf{SegGaussian}, which provides detailed semantic and instance annotations for both Gaussian points and multi-view images. To promote semantic generalization across scenes, we introduce Generalizable Semantic Rasterization (GSR), which leverages a 3D neural network to learn and predict the semantic property for each 3D Gaussian point, where the semantic property can be rendered as multi-view consistent 2D semantic maps. In the next, we propose a Cross-modal Consistency Learning (CCL) framework that utilizes open-vocabulary annotations of 2D images and 3D Gaussians within SegGaussian to train the 3D neural network capable of open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across Gaussian-based 3D scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that OVGaussian significantly outperforms baseline methods, exhibiting robust cross-scene, cross-domain, and novel-view generalization capabilities. Code and the SegGaussian dataset will be released. (https://github.com/runnanchen/OVGaussian).</p></details> |  |

However, unlike vision-language models such as CLIP, self-supervised visual features are not readily aligned with language, hindering their adoption in open-vocabulary tasks. Our method, named dino.txt, unlocks this new ability for DINOv2, a widely used self-supervised visual encoder. We build upon the LiT training strategy, which trains a text encoder to align with a frozen vision model but leads to unsatisfactory results on dense tasks. We propose several key ingredients to improve performance on both global and dense tasks, such as concatenating the [CLS] token with the patch average to train the alignment and curating data using both text and image modalities. With these, we successfully train a CLIP-like model with only a fraction of the computational cost compared to CLIP while achieving state-of-the-art results in zero-shot classification and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Feature Pyramid Tokenization and Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14145v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The visual understanding are often approached from 3 granular levels: image, patch and pixel. Visual Tokenization, trained by self-supervised reconstructive learning, compresses visual data by codebook in patch-level with marginal information loss, but the visual tokens does not have semantic meaning. Open Vocabulary semantic segmentation benefits from the evolving Vision-Language models (VLMs) with strong image zero-shot capability, but transferring image-level to pixel-level understanding remains an imminent challenge. In this paper, we treat segmentation as tokenizing pixels and study a united perceptual and semantic token compression for all granular understanding and consequently facilitate open vocabulary semantic segmentation. Referring to the cognitive process of pretrained VLM where the low-level features are progressively composed to high-level semantics, we propose Feature Pyramid Tokenization (PAT) to cluster and represent multi-resolution feature by learnable codebooks and then decode them by joint learning pixel reconstruction and semantic segmentation. We design loosely coupled pixel and semantic learning branches. The pixel branch simulates bottom-up composition and top-down visualization of codebook tokens, while the semantic branch collectively fuse hierarchical codebooks as auxiliary segmentation guidance. Our experiments show that PAT enhances the semantic intuition of VLM feature pyramid, improves performance over the baseline segmentation model and achieves competitive performance on open vocabulary semantic segmentation benchmark. Our model is parameter-efficient for VLM integration and flexible for the independent tokenization. We hope to give inspiration not only on improving segmentation but also on semantic visual token utilization.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

To address this, researchers have explored two independent approaches: adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and leveraging synthetic data. However, VLMs often struggle with granularity, failing to disentangle fine-grained concepts, while synthetic data-based methods remain limited by the scope of available datasets. This paper proposes enhancing segmentation accuracy across diverse domains by integrating Vision-Language reasoning with key strategies for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). First, we improve the fine-grained segmentation capabilities of VLMs through multi-scale contextual data, robust text embeddings with prompt augmentation, and layer-wise fine-tuning in our proposed Foundational-Retaining Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (FROVSS) framework. Next, we incorporate these enhancements into a UDA framework by employing distillation to stabilize training and cross-domain mixed sampling to boost adaptability without compromising generalization. The resulting UDA-FROVSS framework is the first UDA approach to effectively adapt across domains without requiring shared categories.</p></details> |  |

Typical solutions involve either freezing CLIP during training to unilaterally maintain its zero-shot capability, or fine-tuning CLIP vision encoder to achieve perceptual sensitivity to local regions. However, few of them incorporate vision-text collaborative optimization. Based on this, we propose the Content-Dependent Transfer to adaptively enhance each text embedding by interacting with the input image, which presents a parameter-efficient way to optimize the text representation. Besides, we additionally introduce a Representation Compensation strategy, reviewing the original CLIP-V representation as compensation to maintain the zero-shot capability of CLIP. In this way, the vision and text representation of CLIP are optimized collaboratively, enhancing the alignment of the vision-text feature space. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to establish the collaborative vision-text optimizing mechanism within the OVS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior performance on popular OVS benchmarks. In open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches by +0.5, +2.3, +3.4, +0.4 and +1.1 mIoU, respectively on A-847, A-150, PC-459, PC-59 and PAS-20. Furthermore, in a panoptic setting on ADE20K, we achieve the performance of 27.1 PQ, 73.5 SQ, and 32.9 RQ.

Recent studies have expanded their applications in autonomous reconstruction through task assignment methods. However, these methods are mainly limited to single robot, and rapid reconstruction of large-scale scenes remains challenging. Additionally, task-driven planning based on surface uncertainty is prone to being trapped in local optima. To this end, we propose the first 3DGS-based centralized multi-robot autonomous 3D reconstruction framework. To further reduce time cost of task generation and improve reconstruction quality, we integrate online open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with surface uncertainty of 3DGS, focusing view sampling on regions with high instance uncertainty. Finally, we develop a multi-robot collaboration strategy with mode and task assignments improving reconstruction quality while ensuring planning efficiency. Our method demonstrates the highest reconstruction quality among all planning methods and superior planning efficiency compared to existing multi-robot methods. We deploy our method on multiple robots, and results show that it can effectively plan view paths and reconstruct scenes with high quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMSeg: Unleashing the Power of Large-Scale Models for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00364v1)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is widely agreed that open-vocabulary-based approaches outperform classical closed-set training solutions for recognizing unseen objects in images for semantic segmentation. Existing open-vocabulary approaches leverage vision-language models, such as CLIP, to align visual features with rich semantic features acquired through pre-training on large-scale vision-language datasets. However, the text prompts employed in these methods are short phrases based on fixed templates, failing to capture comprehensive object attributes. Moreover, while the CLIP model excels at exploiting image-level features, it is less effective at pixel-level representation, which is crucial for semantic segmentation tasks. In this work, we propose to alleviate the above-mentioned issues by leveraging multiple large-scale models to enhance the alignment between fine-grained visual features and enriched linguistic features. Specifically, our method employs large language models (LLMs) to generate enriched language prompts with diverse visual attributes for each category, including color, shape/size, and texture/material. Additionally, for enhanced visual feature extraction, the SAM model is adopted as a supplement to the CLIP visual encoder through a proposed learnable weighted fusion strategy. Built upon these techniques, our method, termed LMSeg, achieves state-of-the-art performance across all major open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks. The code will be made available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning in Hyperspherical Space for Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18840v2)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation seeks to label each pixel in an image with arbitrary text descriptions. Vision-language foundation models, especially CLIP, have recently emerged as powerful tools for acquiring open-vocabulary capabilities. However, fine-tuning CLIP to equip it with pixel-level prediction ability often suffers three issues: 1) high computational cost, 2) misalignment between the two inherent modalities of CLIP, and 3) degraded generalization ability on unseen categories. To address these issues, we propose H-CLIP a symmetrical parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy conducted in hyperspherical space for both of the two CLIP modalities. Specifically, the PEFT strategy is achieved by a series of efficient block-diagonal learnable transformation matrices and a dual cross-relation communication module among all learnable matrices. Since the PEFT strategy is conducted symmetrically to the two CLIP modalities, the misalignment between them is mitigated. Furthermore, we apply an additional constraint to PEFT on the CLIP text encoder according to the hyperspherical energy principle, i.e., minimizing hyperspherical energy during fine-tuning preserves the intrinsic structure of the original parameter space, to prevent the destruction of the generalization ability offered by the CLIP text encoder. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks show that H-CLIP achieves new SOTA open-vocabulary semantic segmentation results while only requiring updating approximately 4% of the total parameters of CLIP.</p></details> |  |

The key is to improve spatial representation of image-level CLIP, such as replacing self-attention map at last layer with self-self attention map or vision foundation model based attention map. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical framework, named CLIPer, that hierarchically improves spatial representation of CLIP. The proposed CLIPer includes an early-layer fusion module and a fine-grained compensation module. We observe that, the embeddings and attention maps at early layers can preserve spatial structural information. Inspired by this, we design the early-layer fusion module to generate segmentation map with better spatial coherence. Afterwards, we employ a fine-grained compensation module to compensate the local details using the self-attention maps of diffusion model. We conduct the experiments on seven segmentation datasets. Our proposed CLIPer achieves the state-of-the-art performance on these datasets. For instance, using ViT-L, CLIPer has the mIoU of 69.8% and 43.3% on VOC and COCO Object, outperforming ProxyCLIP by 9.2% and 4.1% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepange and code: https://linsun449.github.io/cliper</p></details> |

Nevertheless, traditional techniques such as global feature alignment or vision-language model distillation tend to impose only approximate correspondence, struggling notably with delineating fine-grained segmentation boundaries. To address this gap, we propose a more meticulous mask-level alignment between 3D features and the 2D-text embedding space through a cross-modal mask reasoning framework, XMask3D. In our approach, we developed a mask generator based on the denoising UNet from a pre-trained diffusion model, leveraging its capability for precise textual control over dense pixel representations and enhancing the open-world adaptability of the generated masks. We further integrate 3D global features as implicit conditions into the pre-trained 2D denoising UNet, enabling the generation of segmentation masks with additional 3D geometry awareness. Subsequently, the generated 2D masks are employed to align mask-level 3D representations with the vision-language feature space, thereby augmenting the open vocabulary capability of 3D geometry embeddings. Finally, we fuse complementary 2D and 3D mask features, resulting in competitive performance across multiple benchmarks for 3D open vocabulary semantic segmentation.

Pixel-level interpretation is a critical aspect of remote sensing image applications; however, a prevalent limitation remains the need for extensive manual annotation. For this, we try to introduce open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) into the remote sensing context. However, due to the sensitivity of remote sensing images to low-resolution features, distorted target shapes and ill-fitting boundaries are exhibited in the prediction mask. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple and general upsampler, SimFeatUp, to restore lost spatial information in deep features in a training-free style. Further, based on the observation of the abnormal response of local patch tokens to [CLS] token in CLIP, we propose to execute a straightforward subtraction operation to alleviate the global bias in patch tokens. Extensive experiments are conducted on 17 remote sensing datasets spanning semantic segmentation, building extraction, road detection, and flood detection tasks. Our method achieves an average of 5.8%, 8.2%, 4.0%, and 15.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods on 4 tasks.

Meanwhile, the recent Open-vocabulary Semantic Scene understanding based on large-scale vision language models is effective in open-set settings because it can learn diverse concepts and categories. However, these prior methods fail to generalize across different camera views due to the lack of cross-view geometric modeling. At present, there are limited studies analyzing cross-view learning. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Unsupervised Cross-view Adaptation Learning approach to modeling the geometric structural change across views in Semantic Scene Understanding. First, we introduce a novel Cross-view Geometric Constraint on Unpaired Data to model structural changes in images and segmentation masks across cameras. Second, we present a new Geodesic Flow-based Correlation Metric to efficiently measure the geometric structural changes across camera views. Third, we introduce a novel view-condition prompting mechanism to enhance the view-information modeling of the open-vocabulary segmentation network in cross-view adaptation learning. The experiments on different cross-view adaptation benchmarks have shown the effectiveness of our approach in cross-view modeling, demonstrating that we achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance compared to prior unsupervised domain adaptation and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS'24</p></details> |

Traditional RGB-T semantic segmentation models often struggle to generalize across diverse scenarios due to their reliance on pretrained models and predefined categories. Recent advancements in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have facilitated a shift from closed-set to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods. However, these models face challenges in dealing with intricate scenes, primarily due to the heterogeneity between RGB and thermal modalities. To address this gap, we present Open-RGBT, a novel open-vocabulary RGB-T semantic segmentation model. Specifically, we obtain instance-level detection proposals by incorporating visual prompts to enhance category understanding. Additionally, we employ the CLIP model to assess image-text similarity, which helps correct semantic consistency and mitigates ambiguities in category identification. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Open-RGBT achieves superior performance in diverse and challenging real-world scenarios, even in the wild, significantly advancing the field of RGB-T semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, unlike previous research that ignores the ``noise'' raised during feature projection from 2D to 3D, we propose a novel distillation learning framework named CUS3D. In our approach, an object-level denosing projection module is designed to screen out the ``noise'' and ensure more accurate 3D feature. Based on the obtained features, a multimodal distillation learning module is designed to align the 3D feature with CLIP semantic feature space with object-centered constrains to achieve advanced unsupervised semantic segmentation. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both unsupervised and open-vocabulary segmentation, and the results consistently showcase the superiority of our model in achieving advanced unsupervised segmentation results and its effectiveness in open-vocabulary segmentation.</p></details> | 6 pages,3 figures |

Meanwhile, vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, have showcased remarkable effectiveness in numerous zero-shot image-level tasks, owing to their robust generalizability. Recently, a body of work has investigated utilizing these models in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However, existing approaches often rely on impractical supervised pre-training or access to additional pre-trained networks. In this work, we propose a strong baseline for training-free OVSS, termed Neighbour-Aware CLIP (NACLIP), representing a straightforward adaptation of CLIP tailored for this scenario. Our method enforces localization of patches in the self-attention of CLIP's vision transformer which, despite being crucial for dense prediction tasks, has been overlooked in the OVSS literature. By incorporating design choices favouring segmentation, our approach significantly improves performance without requiring additional data, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or extensive hyperparameter tuning, making it highly practical for real-world applications.

However, existing approaches utilizing CLIP's text and patch embeddings to generate semantic masks often misidentify input pixels from unseen classes, leading to confusion between novel classes and semantically similar ones. In this work, we propose a novel approach, TagCLIP (Trusty-aware guided CLIP), to address this issue. We disentangle the ill-posed optimization problem into two parallel processes: semantic matching performed individually and reliability judgment for improving discrimination ability. Building on the idea of special tokens in language modeling representing sentence-level embeddings, we introduce a trusty token that enables distinguishing novel classes from known ones in prediction. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, COCO-Stuff 164K and PASCAL Context. Our results show that TagCLIP improves the Intersection over Union (IoU) of unseen classes by 7.4%, 1.7% and 2.1%, respectively, with negligible overheads.

However, challenges arise due to limited event-based data and the absence of large-scale segmentation benchmarks. Current works are confined to closed-set semantic segmentation, limiting their adaptability to other applications. In this paper, we introduce OVOSE, the first Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation algorithm for Event cameras. OVOSE leverages synthetic event data and knowledge distillation from a pre-trained image-based foundation model to an event-based counterpart, effectively preserving spatial context and transferring open-vocabulary semantic segmentation capabilities. We evaluate the performance of OVOSE on two driving semantic segmentation datasets DDD17, and DSEC-Semantic, comparing it with existing conventional image open-vocabulary models adapted for event-based data. Similarly, we compare OVOSE with state-of-the-art methods designed for closed-set settings in unsupervised domain adaptation for event-based semantic segmentation.

Plenty of the previous art casts this task as pixel-to-text classification without object-level comprehension, leveraging the image-to-text classification capability of pretrained vision-and-language models. We argue that visual objects are distinguishable without the prior text information as segmentation is essentially a vision task. Lazy visual grounding first discovers object masks covering an image with iterative Normalized cuts and then later assigns text on the discovered objects in a late interaction manner.

While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models shine in recognizing visual concepts from text, they often struggle with segment coherence due to their limited localization ability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) excel at acquiring spatially consistent local visual representations, yet they fall short in semantic understanding. This paper introduces ProxyCLIP, an innovative framework designed to harmonize the strengths of both CLIP and VFMs, facilitating enhanced open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. ProxyCLIP leverages the spatial feature correspondence from VFMs as a form of proxy attention to augment CLIP, thereby inheriting the VFMs' robust local consistency and maintaining CLIP's exceptional zero-shot transfer capacity. We propose an adaptive normalization and masking strategy to get the proxy attention from VFMs, allowing for adaptation across different VFMs. Remarkably, as a training-free approach, ProxyCLIP significantly improves the average mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) across eight benchmarks from 40.3 to 44.4, showcasing its exceptional efficacy in bridging the gap between spatial precision and semantic richness for the open-vocabulary segmentation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

In this paper, we carefully re-investigate the architecture of CLIP, and identify residual connections as the primary source of noise that degrades segmentation quality. With a comparative analysis of statistical properties in the residual connection and the attention output across different pretrained models, we discover that CLIP's image-text contrastive training paradigm emphasizes global features at the expense of local discriminability, leading to noisy segmentation results. In response, we propose ClearCLIP, a novel approach that decomposes CLIP's representations to enhance open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. We introduce three simple modifications to the final layer: removing the residual connection, implementing the self-self attention, and discarding the feed-forward network. ClearCLIP consistently generates clearer and more accurate segmentation maps and outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks, affirming the significance of our discoveries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024. code available at https://github.com/mc- lan/ClearCLIP</p></details> |

However, it is not only costly to obtain training-sufficient dense-annotated panoramas but also application-restricted when training models in a close-vocabulary setting. To tackle this problem, in this work, we define a new task termed Open Panoramic Segmentation (OPS), where models are trained with FoV-restricted pinhole images in the source domain in an open-vocabulary setting while evaluated with FoV-open panoramic images in the target domain, enabling the zero-shot open panoramic semantic segmentation ability of models. Moreover, we propose a model named OOOPS with a Deformable Adapter Network (DAN), which significantly improves zero-shot panoramic semantic segmentation performance. To further enhance the distortion-aware modeling ability from the pinhole source domain, we propose a novel data augmentation method called Random Equirectangular Projection (RERP) which is specifically designed to address object deformations in advance. Surpassing other state-of-the-art open-vocabulary semantic segmentation approaches, a remarkable performance boost on three panoramic datasets, WildPASS, Stanford2D3D, and Matterport3D, proves the effectiveness of our proposed OOOPS model with RERP on the OPS task, especially +2.2% on outdoor WildPASS and +2.4% mIoU on indoor Stanford2D3D.

However, leveraging the learned association for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet extremely effective, training-free technique, Plug-and-Play Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (PnP-OVSS) for this task. PnP-OVSS leverages a VLM with direct text-to-image cross-attention and an image-text matching loss. To balance between over-segmentation and under-segmentation, we introduce Salience Dropout; by iteratively dropping patches that the model is most attentive to, we are able to better resolve the entire extent of the segmentation mask. PnP-OVSS does not require any neural network training and performs hyperparameter tuning without the need for any segmentation annotations, even for a validation set. PnP-OVSS demonstrates substantial improvements over comparable baselines (+26.2% mIoU on Pascal VOC, +20.5% mIoU on MS COCO, +3.1% mIoU on COCO Stuff and +3.0% mIoU on ADE20K).

| **[Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Image Embedding Balancing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09829v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is a challenging task, which requires the model to output semantic masks of an image beyond a close-set vocabulary. Although many efforts have been made to utilize powerful CLIP models to accomplish this task, they are still easily overfitting to training classes due to the natural gaps in semantic information between training and new classes. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework for openvocabulary semantic segmentation called EBSeg, incorporating an Adaptively Balanced Decoder (AdaB Decoder) and a Semantic Structure Consistency loss (SSC Loss). The AdaB Decoder is designed to generate different image embeddings for both training and new classes. Subsequently, these two types of embeddings are adaptively balanced to fully exploit their ability to recognize training classes and generalization ability for new classes. To learn a consistent semantic structure from CLIP, the SSC Loss aligns the inter-classes affinity in the image feature space with that in the text feature space of CLIP, thereby improving the generalization ability of our model. Furthermore, we employ a frozen SAM image encoder to complement the spatial information that CLIP features lack due to the low training image resolution and image-level supervision inherent in CLIP. Extensive experiments conducted across various benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EBSeg outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Previous works have trained over large amounts of image-caption pairs to enforce pixel-level multimodal alignments. However, captions provide global information about the semantics of a given image but lack direct localization of individual concepts. Further, training on large-scale datasets inevitably brings significant computational costs. In this paper, we propose FreeDA, a training-free diffusion-augmented method for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which leverages the ability of diffusion models to visually localize generated concepts and local-global similarities to match class-agnostic regions with semantic classes. Our approach involves an offline stage in which textual-visual reference embeddings are collected, starting from a large set of captions and leveraging visual and semantic contexts. At test time, these are queried to support the visual matching process, which is carried out by jointly considering class-agnostic regions and global semantic similarities. Extensive analyses demonstrate that FreeDA achieves state-of-the-art performance on five datasets, surpassing previous methods by more than 7.0 average points in terms of mIoU and without requiring any training.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024.

We aggregate the geometry-aware features using a cost volume, and propose a Multi-view Joint Fusion module to aggregate multi-view features through a cross-view attention mechanism, which effectively predicts view-specific blending weights for both colors and open-vocabulary features. Remarkably, our GOV-NeSF exhibits state-of-the-art performance in both 2D and 3D open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, eliminating the need for ground truth semantic labels or depth priors, and effectively generalize across scenes and datasets without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a novel cost-based approach to adapt vision-language foundation models, notably CLIP, for the intricate task of semantic segmentation. Through aggregating the cosine similarity score, i.e., the cost volume between image and text embeddings, our method potently adapts CLIP for segmenting seen and unseen classes by fine-tuning its encoders, addressing the challenges faced by existing methods in handling unseen classes. Building upon this, we explore methods to effectively aggregate the cost volume considering its multi-modal nature of being established between image and text embeddings.

| **[Image-to-Image Matching via Foundation Models: A New Perspective for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00262v1)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment images of arbitrary categories specified by class labels or captions. However, most previous best-performing methods, whether pixel grouping methods or region recognition methods, suffer from false matches between image features and category labels. We attribute this to the natural gap between the textual features and visual features. In this work, we rethink how to mitigate false matches from the perspective of image-to-image matching and propose a novel relation-aware intra-modal matching (RIM) framework for OVS based on visual foundation models. RIM achieves robust region classification by firstly constructing diverse image-modal reference features and then matching them with region features based on relation-aware ranking distribution. The proposed RIM enjoys several merits. First, the intra-modal reference features are better aligned, circumventing potential ambiguities that may arise in cross-modal matching. Second, the ranking-based matching process harnesses the structure information implicit in the inter-class relationships, making it more robust than comparing individually. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that RIM outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, obtaining a lead of more than 10% in mIoU on PASCAL VOC benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2024 |

However, its lack of spatial awareness makes it unsuitable for dense computer vision tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation, without an additional fine-tuning step that often uses annotations and can potentially suppress its original open-vocabulary properties. Meanwhile, self-supervised representation methods have demonstrated good localization properties without human-made annotations nor explicit supervision. In this work, we take the best of both worlds and propose an open-vocabulary semantic segmentation method, which does not require any annotations. We propose to locally improve dense MaskCLIP features, which are computed with a simple modification of CLIP's last pooling layer, by integrating localization priors extracted from self-supervised features. By doing so, we greatly improve the performance of MaskCLIP and produce smooth outputs. Moreover, we show that the used self-supervised feature properties can directly be learnt from CLIP features. Our method CLIP-DINOiser needs only a single forward pass of CLIP and two light convolutional layers at inference, no extra supervision nor extra memory and reaches state-of-the-art results on challenging and fine-grained benchmarks such as COCO, Pascal Context, Cityscapes and ADE20k. The code to reproduce our results is available at https://github.com/wysoczanska/clip_dinoiser.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods face significant challenges, including the need for pixel-level annotations and extensive training. Furthermore, because supervised learning uses a limited set of predefined categories, models typically struggle with rare classes and cannot recognize new ones. Unsupervised and open-vocabulary segmentation, proposed to tackle these issues, faces challenges, including the inability to assign specific class labels to clusters and the necessity of user-provided text queries for guidance. In this context, we propose a novel approach, TAG which achieves Training, Annotation, and Guidance-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. TAG utilizes pre-trained models such as CLIP and DINO to segment images into meaningful categories without additional training or dense annotations. It retrieves class labels from an external database, providing flexibility to adapt to new scenarios. Our TAG achieves state-of-the-art results on PascalVOC, PascalContext and ADE20K for open-vocabulary segmentation without given class names, i.e. improvement of +15.3 mIoU on PascalVOC.

Additionally, due to the limited predefined categories in supervised learning, models typically struggle with infrequent classes and are unable to predict novel classes. To address these limitations, we propose MaskDiffusion, an innovative approach that leverages pretrained frozen Stable Diffusion to achieve open-vocabulary semantic segmentation without the need for additional training or annotation, leading to improved performance compared to similar methods. We also demonstrate the superior performance of MaskDiffusion in handling open vocabularies, including fine-grained and proper noun-based categories, thus expanding the scope of segmentation applications. Overall, our MaskDiffusion shows significant qualitative and quantitative improvements in contrast to other comparable unsupervised segmentation methods, i.e. on the Potsdam dataset (+10.5 mIoU compared to GEM) and COCO-Stuff (+14.8 mIoU compared to DiffSeg).

Nevertheless, current approaches encounter an alignment granularity gap owing to the absence of dense annotations, wherein they learn coarse image/region-text alignment during training yet perform group/pixel-level predictions at inference. Such discrepancy leads to suboptimal learning efficiency and inferior zero-shot segmentation results. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Grained Cross-modal Alignment (MGCA) framework, which explicitly learns pixel-level alignment along with object- and region-level alignment to bridge the granularity gap without any dense annotations. Specifically, MGCA ingeniously constructs pseudo multi-granular semantic correspondences upon image-text pairs and collaborates with hard sampling strategies to facilitate fine-grained cross-modal contrastive learning. Further, we point out the defects of existing group and pixel prediction units in downstream segmentation and develop an adaptive semantic unit which effectively mitigates their dilemmas including under- and over-segmentation. Training solely on CC3M, our method achieves significant advancements over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

Most existing methods explore utilizing pre-trained vision-language models, in which the key is to adopt the image-level model for pixel-level segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a simple encoder-decoder, named SED, for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which comprises a hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation and a gradual fusion decoder with category early rejection. The hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation employs hierarchical backbone, instead of plain transformer, to predict pixel-level image-text cost map. Compared to plain transformer, hierarchical backbone better captures local spatial information and has linear computational complexity with respect to input size. Our gradual fusion decoder employs a top-down structure to combine cost map and the feature maps of different backbone levels for segmentation. To accelerate inference speed, we introduce a category early rejection scheme in the decoder that rejects many no-existing categories at the early layer of decoder, resulting in at most 4.7 times acceleration without accuracy degradation. Experiments are performed on multiple open-vocabulary semantic segmentation datasets, which demonstrates the efficacy of our SED method. When using ConvNeXt-B, our SED method achieves mIoU score of 31.6\% on ADE20K with 150 categories at 82 millisecond ($ms$) per image on a single A6000. We will release it at \url{https://github.com/xb534/SED.git}.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |
| **[Generalizable Semantic Vision Query Generation for Zero-shot Panoptic and Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13697v1)** | 2024-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Panoptic Segmentation (ZPS) aims to recognize foreground instances and background stuff without images containing unseen categories in training. Due to the visual data sparsity and the difficulty of generalizing from seen to unseen categories, this task remains challenging. To better generalize to unseen classes, we propose Conditional tOken aligNment and Cycle trAnsiTion (CONCAT), to produce generalizable semantic vision queries. First, a feature extractor is trained by CON to link the vision and semantics for providing target queries. Formally, CON is proposed to align the semantic queries with the CLIP visual CLS token extracted from complete and masked images. To address the lack of unseen categories, a generator is required. However, one of the gaps in synthesizing pseudo vision queries, ie, vision queries for unseen categories, is describing fine-grained visual details through semantic embeddings. Therefore, we approach CAT to train the generator in semantic-vision and vision-semantic manners. In semantic-vision, visual query contrast is proposed to model the high granularity of vision by pulling the pseudo vision queries with the corresponding targets containing segments while pushing those without segments away. To ensure the generated queries retain semantic information, in vision-semantic, the pseudo vision queries are mapped back to semantic and supervised by real semantic embeddings. Experiments on ZPS achieve a 5.2% hPQ increase surpassing SOTA. We also examine inductive ZPS and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation and obtain comparative results while being 2 times faster in testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Generative and Discriminative Models for Unified Visual Perception with Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16459v1)** | 2024-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable prowess of diffusion models in image generation has spurred efforts to extend their application beyond generative tasks. However, a persistent challenge exists in lacking a unified approach to apply diffusion models to visual perception tasks with diverse semantic granularity requirements. Our purpose is to establish a unified visual perception framework, capitalizing on the potential synergies between generative and discriminative models. In this paper, we propose Vermouth, a simple yet effective framework comprising a pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model containing rich generative priors, a unified head (U-head) capable of integrating hierarchical representations, and an adapted expert providing discriminative priors. Comprehensive investigations unveil potential characteristics of Vermouth, such as varying granularity of perception concealed in latent variables at distinct time steps and various U-net stages. We emphasize that there is no necessity for incorporating a heavyweight or intricate decoder to transform diffusion models into potent representation learners. Extensive comparative evaluations against tailored discriminative models showcase the efficacy of our approach on zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR), few-shot classification, and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks. The promising results demonstrate the potential of diffusion models as formidable learners, establishing their significance in furnishing informative and robust visual representations.</p></details> | 18 pages,11 figures |

In order to learn such pixel-level alignment, current approaches typically rely on a combination of (i) image-level VL model (e.g. CLIP), (ii) ground truth masks, and (iii) custom grouping encoders. In this paper, we introduce S-Seg, a novel model that can achieve surprisingly strong performance without depending on any of the above elements. S-Seg leverages pseudo-mask and language to train a MaskFormer, and can be easily trained from publicly available image-text datasets. Contrary to prior works, our model directly trains for pixel-level features and language alignment. Once trained, S-Seg generalizes well to multiple testing datasets without requiring fine-tuning. In addition, S-Seg has the extra benefits of scalability with data and consistently improvement when augmented with self-training. We believe that our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/zlai0/S-Seg</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Model is Secretly a Training-free Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmenter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02773v3)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-trained text-image discriminative models, such as CLIP, has been explored for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with unsatisfactory results due to the loss of crucial localization information and awareness of object shapes. Recently, there has been a growing interest in expanding the application of generative models from generation tasks to semantic segmentation. These approaches utilize generative models either for generating annotated data or extracting features to facilitate semantic segmentation. This typically involves generating a considerable amount of synthetic data or requiring additional mask annotations. To this end, we uncover the potential of generative text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) as highly efficient open-vocabulary semantic segmenters, and introduce a novel training-free approach named DiffSegmenter. The insight is that to generate realistic objects that are semantically faithful to the input text, both the complete object shapes and the corresponding semantics are implicitly learned by diffusion models. We discover that the object shapes are characterized by the self-attention maps while the semantics are indicated through the cross-attention maps produced by the denoising U-Net, forming the basis of our segmentation results.Additionally, we carefully design effective textual prompts and a category filtering mechanism to further enhance the segmentation results. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed DiffSegmenter achieves impressive results for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Such methods are able to segment scenes into arbitrary classes based on text descriptions provided during runtime. In this paper, we propose to the best of our knowledge the first algorithm for open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation in 3D scenes. Our algorithm, Panoptic Vision-Language Feature Fields (PVLFF), learns a semantic feature field of the scene by distilling vision-language features from a pretrained 2D model, and jointly fits an instance feature field through contrastive learning using 2D instance segments on input frames. Despite not being trained on the target classes, our method achieves panoptic segmentation performance similar to the state-of-the-art closed-set 3D systems on the HyperSim, ScanNet and Replica dataset and additionally outperforms current 3D open-vocabulary systems in terms of semantic segmentation.

Recent studies have explored vision-language pre-training to handle this task, but suffer from unrealistic assumptions in practical scenarios, i.e., low-quality textual category names. For example, this paradigm assumes that new textual categories will be accurately and completely provided, and exist in lexicons during pre-training. However, exceptions often happen when encountering ambiguity for brief or incomplete names, new words that are not present in the pre-trained lexicons, and difficult-to-describe categories for users. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel attribute decomposition-aggregation framework, AttrSeg, inspired by human cognition in understanding new concepts. Specifically, in the decomposition stage, we decouple class names into diverse attribute descriptions to complement semantic contexts from multiple perspectives. Two attribute construction strategies are designed: using large language models for common categories, and involving manually labeling for human-invented categories. In the aggregation stage, we group diverse attributes into an integrated global description, to form a discriminative classifier that distinguishes the target object from others. One hierarchical aggregation architecture is further proposed to achieve multi-level aggregations, leveraging the meticulously designed clustering module. The final results are obtained by computing the similarity between aggregated attributes and images embeddings. To evaluate the effectiveness, we annotate three types of datasets with attribute descriptions, and conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies. The results show the superior performance of attribute decomposition-aggregation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

The zero-shot classification capabilities of the model are impressive but are harder to use for dense tasks such as image segmentation. Several methods have proposed different modifications and learning schemes to produce dense output. Instead, we propose in this work an open-vocabulary semantic segmentation method, dubbed CLIP-DIY, which does not require any additional training or annotations, but instead leverages existing unsupervised object localization approaches. In particular, CLIP-DIY is a multi-scale approach that directly exploits CLIP classification abilities on patches of different sizes and aggregates the decision in a single map. We further guide the segmentation using foreground/background scores obtained using unsupervised object localization methods.

| **[Convolutions Die Hard: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation with Single Frozen Convolutional CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02487v2)** | 2023-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary segmentation is a challenging task requiring segmenting and recognizing objects from an open set of categories. One way to address this challenge is to leverage multi-modal models, such as CLIP, to provide image and text features in a shared embedding space, which bridges the gap between closed-vocabulary and open-vocabulary recognition. Hence, existing methods often adopt a two-stage framework to tackle the problem, where the inputs first go through a mask generator and then through the CLIP model along with the predicted masks. This process involves extracting features from images multiple times, which can be ineffective and inefficient. By contrast, we propose to build everything into a single-stage framework using a shared Frozen Convolutional CLIP backbone, which not only significantly simplifies the current two-stage pipeline, but also remarkably yields a better accuracy-cost trade-off. The proposed FC-CLIP, benefits from the following observations: the frozen CLIP backbone maintains the ability of open-vocabulary classification and can also serve as a strong mask generator, and the convolutional CLIP generalizes well to a larger input resolution than the one used during contrastive image-text pretraining. When training on COCO panoptic data only and testing in a zero-shot manner, FC-CLIP achieve 26.8 PQ, 16.8 AP, and 34.1 mIoU on ADE20K, 18.2 PQ, 27.9 mIoU on Mapillary Vistas, 44.0 PQ, 26.8 AP, 56.2 mIoU on Cityscapes, outperforming the prior art by +4.2 PQ, +2.4 AP, +4.2 mIoU on ADE20K, +4.0 PQ on Mapillary Vistas and +20.1 PQ on Cityscapes, respectively. Additionally, the training and testing time of FC-CLIP is 7.5x and 6.6x significantly faster than the same prior art, while using 5.9x fewer parameters.

Existing works turn to enhance the vanilla vision transformer by introducing explicit grouping recognition, i.e., employing several group tokens/centroids to cluster the image tokens and perform the group-text alignment. Nevertheless, these methods suffer from a granularity inconsistency regarding the usage of group tokens, which are aligned in the all-to-one v.s. one-to-one manners during the training and inference phases, respectively. We argue that this discrepancy arises from the lack of elaborate supervision for each group token. To bridge this granularity gap, this paper explores explicit supervision for the group tokens from the prototypical knowledge. To this end, this paper proposes the non-learnable prototypical regularization (NPR) where non-learnable prototypes are estimated from source features to serve as supervision and enable contrastive matching of the group tokens. This regularization encourages the group tokens to segment objects with less redundancy and capture more comprehensive semantic regions, leading to increased compactness and richness. Based on NPR, we propose the prototypical guidance segmentation network (PGSeg) that incorporates multi-modal regularization by leveraging prototypical sources from both images and texts at different levels, progressively enhancing the segmentation capability with diverse prototypical patterns. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

While significant progress has been made in object-level Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS), i.e., segmenting objects with arbitrary text, the corresponding part-level research poses additional challenges. Firstly, part segmentation inherently involves intricate boundaries, while limited annotated data compounds the challenge. Secondly, part segmentation introduces an open granularity challenge due to the diverse and often ambiguous definitions of parts in the open world. Furthermore, the large-scale vision and language models, which play a key role in the open vocabulary setting, struggle to recognize parts as effectively as objects. To comprehensively investigate and tackle these challenges, we propose an Open-Vocabulary Part Segmentation (OV-PARTS) benchmark. OV-PARTS includes refined versions of two publicly available datasets: Pascal-Part-116 and ADE20K-Part-234. And it covers three specific tasks: Generalized Zero-Shot Part Segmentation, Cross-Dataset Part Segmentation, and Few-Shot Part Segmentation, providing insights into analogical reasoning, open granularity and few-shot adapting abilities of models. Moreover, we analyze and adapt two prevailing paradigms of existing object-level OVSS methods for OV-PARTS.

| **[Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Decoupled One-Pass Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01198v2)** | 2023-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the open-vocabulary semantic segmentation problem has attracted increasing attention and the best performing methods are based on two-stream networks: one stream for proposal mask generation and the other for segment classification using a pretrained visual-language model. However, existing two-stream methods require passing a great number of (up to a hundred) image crops into the visual-language model, which is highly inefficient. To address the problem, we propose a network that only needs a single pass through the visual-language model for each input image. Specifically, we first propose a novel network adaptation approach, termed patch severance, to restrict the harmful interference between the patch embeddings in the pre-trained visual encoder. We then propose classification anchor learning to encourage the network to spatially focus on more discriminative features for classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods while being 4 to 7 times faster at inference.

| **[Global Knowledge Calibration for Fast Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09181v2)** | 2023-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, have enabled the segmentation of arbitrary concepts solely from textual inputs, a process commonly referred to as open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS). However, existing OVS techniques confront a fundamental challenge: the trained classifier tends to overfit on the base classes observed during training, resulting in suboptimal generalization performance to unseen classes. To mitigate this issue, recent studies have proposed the use of an additional frozen pre-trained CLIP for classification. Nonetheless, this approach incurs heavy computational overheads as the CLIP vision encoder must be repeatedly forward-passed for each mask, rendering it impractical for real-world applications. To address this challenge, our objective is to develop a fast OVS model that can perform comparably or better without the extra computational burden of the CLIP image encoder during inference. To this end, we propose a core idea of preserving the generalizable representation when fine-tuning on known classes. Specifically, we introduce a text diversification strategy that generates a set of synonyms for each training category, which prevents the learned representation from collapsing onto specific known category names. Additionally, we employ a text-guided knowledge distillation method to preserve the generalizable knowledge of CLIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves robust generalization performance across various datasets. Furthermore, we perform a preliminary exploration of open-vocabulary video segmentation and present a benchmark that can facilitate future open-vocabulary research in the video domain.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2023 |

The pre-trained model can capture enriched visual concepts for images by learning from a large scale of text-image data. However, transferring the learned visual knowledge to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a CLIP-based model named SegCLIP for the topic of open-vocabulary segmentation in an annotation-free manner. The SegCLIP achieves segmentation based on ViT and the main idea is to gather patches with learnable centers to semantic regions through training on text-image pairs. The gathering operation can dynamically capture the semantic groups, which can be used to generate the final segmentation results. We further propose a reconstruction loss on masked patches and a superpixel-based KL loss with pseudo-labels to enhance the visual representation. Experimental results show that our model achieves comparable or superior segmentation accuracy on the PASCAL VOC 2012 (+0.3% mIoU), PASCAL Context (+2.3% mIoU), and COCO (+2.2% mIoU) compared with baselines.

However, existing approaches often rely on expensive human annotations as supervision for model training, limiting their scalability to large, unlabeled datasets. To address this challenge, we present ZeroSeg, a novel method that leverages the existing pretrained vision-language (VL) model (e.g. CLIP) to train open-vocabulary zero-shot semantic segmentation models. Although acquired extensive knowledge of visual concepts, it is non-trivial to exploit knowledge from these VL models to the task of semantic segmentation, as they are usually trained at an image level. ZeroSeg overcomes this by distilling the visual concepts learned by VL models into a set of segment tokens, each summarizing a localized region of the target image. We evaluate ZeroSeg on multiple popular segmentation benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO, in a zero-shot manner (i.e., no training or adaption on target segmentation datasets). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared to other zero-shot segmentation methods under the same training data, while also performing competitively compared to strongly supervised methods. Finally, we also demonstrated the effectiveness of ZeroSeg on open-vocabulary segmentation, through both human studies and qualitative visualizations.</p></details> |  |

| **[MVP-SEG: Multi-View Prompt Learning for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06957v1)** | 2023-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) is well-developed for open-vocabulary zero-shot image-level recognition, while its applications in pixel-level tasks are less investigated, where most efforts directly adopt CLIP features without deliberative adaptations. In this work, we first demonstrate the necessity of image-pixel CLIP feature adaption, then provide Multi-View Prompt learning (MVP-SEG) as an effective solution to achieve image-pixel adaptation and to solve open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Concretely, MVP-SEG deliberately learns multiple prompts trained by our Orthogonal Constraint Loss (OCLoss), by which each prompt is supervised to exploit CLIP feature on different object parts, and collaborative segmentation masks generated by all prompts promote better segmentation. Moreover, MVP-SEG introduces Global Prompt Refining (GPR) to further eliminate class-wise segmentation noise. Experiments show that the multi-view prompts learned from seen categories have strong generalization to unseen categories, and MVP-SEG+ which combines the knowledge transfer stage significantly outperforms previous methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, qualitative results justify that MVP-SEG does lead to better focus on different local parts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Mask-adapted CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04150v3)** | 2023-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to segment an image into semantic regions according to text descriptions, which may not have been seen during training. Recent two-stage methods first generate class-agnostic mask proposals and then leverage pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, to classify masked regions. We identify the performance bottleneck of this paradigm to be the pre-trained CLIP model, since it does not perform well on masked images. To address this, we propose to finetune CLIP on a collection of masked image regions and their corresponding text descriptions. We collect training data by mining an existing image-caption dataset (e.g., COCO Captions), using CLIP to match masked image regions to nouns in the image captions. Compared with the more precise and manually annotated segmentation labels with fixed classes (e.g., COCO-Stuff), we find our noisy but diverse dataset can better retain CLIP's generalization ability. Along with finetuning the entire model, we utilize the "blank" areas in masked images using a method we dub mask prompt tuning. Experiments demonstrate mask prompt tuning brings significant improvement without modifying any weights of CLIP, and it can further improve a fully finetuned model. In particular, when trained on COCO and evaluated on ADE20K-150, our best model achieves 29.6% mIoU, which is +8.5% higher than the previous state-of-the-art. For the first time, open-vocabulary generalist models match the performance of supervised specialist models in 2017 without dataset-specific adaptations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2023.

| **[Side Adapter Network for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12242v2)** | 2023-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a new framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with the pre-trained vision-language model, named Side Adapter Network (SAN). Our approach models the semantic segmentation task as a region recognition problem. A side network is attached to a frozen CLIP model with two branches: one for predicting mask proposals, and the other for predicting attention bias which is applied in the CLIP model to recognize the class of masks. This decoupled design has the benefit CLIP in recognizing the class of mask proposals. Since the attached side network can reuse CLIP features, it can be very light. In addition, the entire network can be trained end-to-end, allowing the side network to be adapted to the frozen CLIP model, which makes the predicted mask proposals CLIP-aware. Our approach is fast, accurate, and only adds a few additional trainable parameters. We evaluate our approach on multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our method significantly outperforms other counterparts, with up to 18 times fewer trainable parameters and 19 times faster inference speed. We hope our approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. The code will be available at https://github.com/MendelXu/SAN.</p></details> | CVPR2023 Highlight |
| **[Learning Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation Models From Natural Language Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09121v2)** | 2023-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the problem of open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS), which aims to segment objects of arbitrary classes instead of pre-defined, closed-set categories. The main contributions are as follows: First, we propose a transformer-based model for OVS, termed as OVSegmentor, which only exploits web-crawled image-text pairs for pre-training without using any mask annotations. OVSegmentor assembles the image pixels into a set of learnable group tokens via a slot-attention based binding module, and aligns the group tokens to the corresponding caption embedding. Second, we propose two proxy tasks for training, namely masked entity completion and cross-image mask consistency. The former aims to infer all masked entities in the caption given the group tokens, that enables the model to learn fine-grained alignment between visual groups and text entities. The latter enforces consistent mask predictions between images that contain shared entities, which encourages the model to learn visual invariance. Third, we construct CC4M dataset for pre-training by filtering CC12M with frequently appeared entities, which significantly improves training efficiency. Fourth, we perform zero-shot transfer on three benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object. Our model achieves superior segmentation results over the state-of-the-art method by using only 3\% data (4M vs 134M) for pre-training. Code and pre-trained models will be released for future research.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2023 |
| **[A Language-Guided Benchmark for Weakly Supervised Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14163v1)** | 2023-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasing attention is being diverted to data-efficient problem settings like Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) which deals with segmenting an arbitrary object that may or may not be seen during training. The closest standard problems related to OVSS are Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Segmentation (ZSS, FSS) and their Cross-dataset variants where zero to few annotations are needed to segment novel classes. The existing FSS and ZSS methods utilize fully supervised pixel-labelled seen classes to segment unseen classes. Pixel-level labels are hard to obtain, and using weak supervision in the form of inexpensive image-level labels is often more practical. To this end, we propose a novel unified weakly supervised OVSS pipeline that can perform ZSS, FSS and Cross-dataset segmentation on novel classes without using pixel-level labels for either the base (seen) or the novel (unseen) classes in an inductive setting. We propose Weakly-Supervised Language-Guided Segmentation Network (WLSegNet), a novel language-guided segmentation pipeline that i) learns generalizable context vectors with batch aggregates (mean) to map class prompts to image features using frozen CLIP (a vision-language model) and ii) decouples weak ZSS/FSS into weak semantic segmentation and Zero-Shot segmentation. The learned context vectors avoid overfitting on seen classes during training and transfer better to novel classes during testing. WLSegNet avoids fine-tuning and the use of external datasets during training. The proposed pipeline beats existing methods for weak generalized Zero-Shot and weak Few-Shot semantic segmentation by 39 and 3 mIOU points respectively on PASCAL VOC and weak Few-Shot semantic segmentation by 5 mIOU points on MS COCO. On a harder setting of 2-way 1-shot weak FSS, WLSegNet beats the baselines by 13 and 22 mIOU points on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class Enhancement Losses with Pseudo Labels for Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07336v1)** | 2023-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent mask proposal models have significantly improved the performance of zero-shot semantic segmentation. However, the use of a `background' embedding during training in these methods is problematic as the resulting model tends to over-learn and assign all unseen classes as the background class instead of their correct labels. Furthermore, they ignore the semantic relationship of text embeddings, which arguably can be highly informative for zero-shot prediction as seen classes may have close relationship with unseen classes. To this end, this paper proposes novel class enhancement losses to bypass the use of the background embbedding during training, and simultaneously exploit the semantic relationship between text embeddings and mask proposals by ranking the similarity scores. To further capture the relationship between seen and unseen classes, we propose an effective pseudo label generation pipeline using pretrained vision-language model. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our method achieves overall the best performance for zero-shot semantic segmentation. Our method is flexible, and can also be applied to the challenging open-vocabulary semantic segmentation problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Baseline for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Pre-trained Vision-language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14757v2)** | 2022-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, open-vocabulary image classification by vision language pre-training has demonstrated incredible achievements, that the model can classify arbitrary categories without seeing additional annotated images of that category. However, it is still unclear how to make the open-vocabulary recognition work well on broader vision problems. This paper targets open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by building it on an off-the-shelf pre-trained vision-language model, i.e., CLIP. However, semantic segmentation and the CLIP model perform on different visual granularity, that semantic segmentation processes on pixels while CLIP performs on images. To remedy the discrepancy in processing granularity, we refuse the use of the prevalent one-stage FCN based framework, and advocate a two-stage semantic segmentation framework, with the first stage extracting generalizable mask proposals and the second stage leveraging an image based CLIP model to perform open-vocabulary classification on the masked image crops which are generated in the first stage. Our experimental results show that this two-stage framework can achieve superior performance than FCN when trained only on COCO Stuff dataset and evaluated on other datasets without fine-tuning. Moreover, this simple framework also surpasses previous state-of-the-arts of zero-shot semantic segmentation by a large margin: +29.5 hIoU on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset, and +8.9 hIoU on the COCO Stuff dataset. With its simplicity and strong performance, we hope this framework to serve as a baseline to facilitate future research. The code are made publicly available at~\url{https://github.com/MendelXu/zsseg.baseline}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Patch Aligned Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04994v1)** | 2022-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Patch Aligned Contrastive Learning (PACL), a modified compatibility function for CLIP's contrastive loss, intending to train an alignment between the patch tokens of the vision encoder and the CLS token of the text encoder. With such an alignment, a model can identify regions of an image corresponding to a given text input, and therefore transfer seamlessly to the task of open vocabulary semantic segmentation without requiring any segmentation annotations during training. Using pre-trained CLIP encoders with PACL, we are able to set the state-of-the-art on the task of open vocabulary zero-shot segmentation on 4 different segmentation benchmarks: Pascal VOC, Pascal Context, COCO Stuff and ADE20K. Furthermore, we show that PACL is also applicable to image-level predictions and when used with a CLIP backbone, provides a general improvement in zero-shot classification accuracy compared to CLIP, across a suite of 12 image classification datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Frozen Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15138v1)** | 2022-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When trained at a sufficient scale, self-supervised learning has exhibited a notable ability to solve a wide range of visual or language understanding tasks. In this paper, we investigate simple, yet effective approaches for adapting the pre-trained foundation models to the downstream task of interest, namely, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) we introduce Fusioner, with a lightweight, transformer-based fusion module, that pairs the frozen visual representation with language concept through a handful of image segmentation data. As a consequence, the model gains the capability of zero-shot transfer to segment novel categories; (ii) without loss of generality, we experiment on a broad range of self-supervised models that have been pre-trained with different schemes, e.g. visual-only models (MoCo v3, DINO), language-only models (BERT), visual-language model (CLIP), and show that, the proposed fusion approach is effective to any pair of visual and language models, even those pre-trained on a corpus of uni-modal data; (iii) we conduct thorough ablation studies to analyze the critical components in our proposed Fusioner, while evaluating on standard benchmarks, e.g. PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i , it surpasses existing state-of-the-art models by a large margin, despite only being trained on frozen visual and language features; (iv) to measure the model's robustness on learning visual-language correspondence, we further evaluate on synthetic dataset, named Mosaic-4, where images are constructed by mosaicking the samples from FSS-1000. Fusioner demonstrates superior performance over previous models.</p></details> | BMVC 2022 Oral |

| **[SAM 2++: Tracking Anything at Any Granularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18822v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given its initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First, to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++ sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.</p></details> | update results |
| **[EMA-SAM: Exponential Moving-average for SAM-based PTMC Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18213v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with radio-frequency ablation (RFA), yet accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound videos remains difficult due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and heat-related artifacts. The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) generalizes well to static images, but its frame-independent design yields unstable predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound. We introduce \textbf{EMA-SAM}, a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that incorporates a confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank, providing a stable latent prototype of the tumour across frames. This design preserves temporal coherence through probe pressure and bubble occlusion while rapidly adapting once clear evidence reappears. On our curated PTMC-RFA dataset (124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improves \emph{maxDice} from 0.82 (SAM-2) to 0.86 and \emph{maxIoU} from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by 29\%. On external benchmarks, including VTUS and colonoscopy video polyp datasets, EMA-SAM achieves consistent gains of 2--5 Dice points over SAM-2. Importantly, the EMA pointer adds \textless0.1\% FLOPs, preserving real-time throughput of $\sim$30\,FPS on a single A100 GPU. These results establish EMA-SAM as a robust and efficient framework for stable tumour tracking, bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of interventional ultrasound.

| **[CMaP-SAM: Contraction Mapping Prior for SAM-driven Few-shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05049v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment new classes using few annotated images. While recent FSS methods have shown considerable improvements by leveraging Segment Anything Model (SAM), they face two critical limitations: insufficient utilization of structural correlations in query images, and significant information loss when converting continuous position priors to discrete point prompts. To address these challenges, we propose CMaP-SAM, a novel framework that introduces contraction mapping theory to optimize position priors for SAM-driven few-shot segmentation. CMaP-SAM consists of three key components: (1) a contraction mapping module that formulates position prior optimization as a Banach contraction mapping with convergence guarantees. This module iteratively refines position priors through pixel-wise structural similarity, generating a converged prior that preserves both semantic guidance from reference images and structural correlations in query images; (2) an adaptive distribution alignment module bridging continuous priors with SAM's binary mask prompt encoder; and (3) a foreground-background decoupled refinement architecture producing accurate final segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate CMaP-SAM's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 71.1 mIoU on PASCAL-$5^i$ and 56.1 on COCO-$20^i$ datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/Chenfan0206/CMaP-SAM.</p></details> | 7 figures |
| **[Enhancing Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection: CLIP-SAM Collaboration with Cascaded Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11028v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks. However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP metrics, respectively.</p></details> | Accepted by PRCV |
| **[Adapting SAM with Dynamic Similarity Graphs for Few-Shot Parameter-Efficient Small Dense Object Detection: A Case Study of Chickpea Pods in Field Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25805v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only 4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31% improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10 to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[BALR-SAM: Boundary-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation of SAM for Resource-Efficient Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24204v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice, fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8% (11.7M) of its parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[FloorSAM: SAM-Guided Floorplan Reconstruction with Semantic-Geometric Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15750v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing building floor plans from point cloud data is key for indoor navigation, BIM, and precise measurements. Traditional methods like geometric algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise, limited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a framework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we create robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for precise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts. Room masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering, followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and regularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room topological relationships. Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy and complex settings.

| **[Re-purposing SAM into Efficient Visual Projectors for MLLM-Based Referring Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13676v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) frameworks that pair the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have achieved impressive results. However, adapting MLLM to segmentation is computationally intensive, primarily due to visual token redundancy. We observe that traditional patch-wise visual projectors struggle to strike a balance between reducing the number of visual tokens and preserving semantic clarity, often retaining overly long token sequences to avoid performance drops. Inspired by text tokenizers, we propose a novel semantic visual projector that leverages semantic superpixels generated by SAM to identify "visual words" in an image. By compressing and projecting semantic superpixels as visual tokens, our approach adaptively shortens the token sequence according to scene complexity while minimizing semantic loss in compression. To mitigate loss of information, we propose a semantic superpixel positional embedding to strengthen MLLM's awareness of superpixel geometry and position, alongside a semantic superpixel aggregator to preserve both fine-grained details inside superpixels and global context outside. Experiments show that our method cuts visual tokens by 93% without compromising performance, notably speeding up MLLM training and inference, and outperforming existing compressive visual projectors on RIS.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAMIR, an efficient registration framework via robust feature learning from SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13629v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis. Deformations are often closely related to the morphological characteristics of tissues, making accurate feature extraction crucial. Recent weakly supervised methods improve registration by incorporating anatomical priors such as segmentation masks or landmarks, either as inputs or in the loss function. However, such weak labels are often not readily available, limiting their practical use. Motivated by the strong representation learning ability of visual foundation models, this paper introduces SAMIR, an efficient medical image registration framework that utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance feature extraction. SAM is pretrained on large-scale natural image datasets and can learn robust, general-purpose visual representations. Rather than using raw input images, we design a task-specific adaptation pipeline using SAM's image encoder to extract structure-aware feature embeddings, enabling more accurate modeling of anatomical consistency and deformation patterns. We further design a lightweight 3D head to refine features within the embedding space, adapting to local deformations in medical images. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Feature Consistency Loss to guide coarse-to-fine feature matching and improve anatomical alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAMIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets for both intra-subject cardiac image registration and inter-subject abdomen CT image registration, achieving performance improvements of 2.68% on ACDC and 6.44% on the abdomen dataset. The source code will be publicly available on GitHub following the acceptance of this paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal SAM-adapter for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10408v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation, a key task in computer vision with broad applications in autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics, has advanced substantially with deep learning. Nevertheless, current approaches remain vulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and adverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that integrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged, providing complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we present MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed method employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into SAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong generalization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating auxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM SAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We evaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES, where MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze modality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard subsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms competing methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding.

| **[SGDFuse: SAM-Guided Diffusion for High-Fidelity Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05264v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks. However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at https://github.com/boshizhang123/SGDFuse.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Information Fusion</p></details> |

This task can be performed using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability. However, foundational models often present a considerable number of non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization, limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$, that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces, and nanoscale features.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |
| **[EdgeSAM: Prompt-In-the-Loop Distillation for SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06660v3)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents EdgeSAM, an accelerated variant of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), optimized for efficient execution on edge devices with minimal compromise in performance. Our approach involves distilling the original ViT-based SAM image encoder into a purely CNN-based architecture, better suited for edge devices. We carefully benchmark various distillation strategies and demonstrate that task-agnostic encoder distillation fails to capture the full knowledge embodied in SAM. To overcome this bottleneck, we include both the prompt encoder and mask decoder in the distillation process, with box and point prompts in the loop, so that the distilled model can accurately capture the intricate dynamics between user input and mask generation. To mitigate dataset bias issues stemming from point prompt distillation, we incorporate a lightweight module within the encoder. As a result, EdgeSAM achieves a 37-fold speed increase compared to the original SAM, and it also outperforms MobileSAM/EfficientSAM, being over 7 times as fast when deployed on edge devices while enhancing the mIoUs on COCO and LVIS by 2.3/1.5 and 3.1/1.6, respectively. It is also the first SAM variant that can run at over 30 FPS on an iPhone 14.

However, these models struggle in adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging, where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases, we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter (UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts. We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets. Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather, while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Repurposing SAM for User-Defined Semantics Aware Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02420v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) excels at generating precise object masks from input prompts but lacks semantic awareness, failing to associate its generated masks with specific object categories. To address this limitation, we propose U-SAM, a novel framework that imbibes semantic awareness into SAM, enabling it to generate targeted masks for user-specified object categories. Given only object class names as input from the user, U-SAM provides pixel-level semantic annotations for images without requiring any labeled/unlabeled samples from the test data distribution. Our approach leverages synthetically generated or web crawled images to accumulate semantic information about the desired object classes. We then learn a mapping function between SAM's mask embeddings and object class labels, effectively enhancing SAM with granularity-specific semantic recognition capabilities. As a result, users can obtain meaningful and targeted segmentation masks for specific objects they request, rather than generic and unlabeled masks. We evaluate U-SAM on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MSCOCO-80, achieving significant mIoU improvements of +17.95% and +5.20%, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods. By transforming SAM into a semantically aware segmentation model, U-SAM offers a practical and flexible solution for pixel-level annotation across diverse and unseen domains in a resource-constrained environment.</p></details> |  |

A critical challenge arises from the domain gap between natural images and medical volumes: existing FMs, pre-trained on 2D data, struggle to capture 3D anatomical context, limiting their utility in clinical applications like tumor segmentation. To address this, we propose an adaptation framework called TAGS: Tumor Adaptive Guidance for SAM, which unlocks 2D FMs for 3D medical tasks through multi-prompt fusion. By preserving most of the pre-trained weights, our approach enhances SAM's spatial feature extraction using CLIP's semantic insights and anatomy-specific prompts. Extensive experiments on three open-source tumor segmentation datasets prove that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models (+46.88% over nnUNet), interactive segmentation frameworks, and other established medical FMs, including SAM-Med2D, SAM-Med3D, SegVol, Universal, 3D-Adapter, and SAM-B (at least +13% over them). This highlights the robustness and adaptability of our proposed framework across diverse medical segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV-APAH</p></details> |

Leveraging such unprecedented data diversity, they exhibit strong open-world segmentation capabilities, with SAM~2 further enhancing these capabilities to support high-quality video segmentation. While SAMs (SAM and SAM~2) have demonstrated excellent performance in segmenting context-independent concepts like people, cars, and roads, they overlook more challenging context-dependent (CD) concepts, such as visual saliency, camouflage, industrial defects, and medical lesions. CD concepts rely heavily on global and local contextual information, making them susceptible to shifts in different contexts, which requires strong discriminative capabilities from the model. The lack of comprehensive evaluation of SAMs limits understanding of their performance boundaries, which may hinder the design of future models. In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of SAMs on 11 CD concepts across 2D and 3D images and videos in various visual modalities within natural, medical, and industrial scenes. We develop a unified evaluation framework for SAM and SAM~2 that supports manual, automatic, and intermediate self-prompting, aided by our specific prompt generation and interaction strategies. We further explore the potential of SAM~2 for in-context learning and introduce prompt robustness testing to simulate real-world imperfect prompts. Finally, we analyze the benefits and limitations of SAMs in understanding CD concepts and discuss their future development in segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission to International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)</p></details> |

To overcome these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image), (ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\% vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability, and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs, advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications.

This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods: prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, accepted by Journal of Medical Imaging</p></details> |

Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pre-trained on millions of natural images, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot segmentation performance, providing a potential solution. However, SAM struggles with geographical images, such as aerial and satellite imagery, due to its training being confined to natural images and the narrow features and textures of these objects blending into their surroundings. To address these challenges, we propose Geographical SAM (GeoSAM), a SAM-based framework that fine-tunes SAM using automatically generated multi-modal prompts. Specifically, GeoSAM integrates point prompts from a pre-trained task-specific model as primary visual guidance, and text prompts generated by a large language model as secondary semantic guidance, enabling the model to better capture both spatial structure and contextual meaning. GeoSAM outperforms existing approaches for mobility infrastructure segmentation in both familiar and completely unseen regions by at least 5\% in mIoU, representing a significant leap in leveraging foundation models to segment mobility infrastructure, including both road and pedestrian infrastructure in geographical images.

They learn general representations that are easily transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images. We propose adapting the SAM encoder via fine-tuning for remote sensing change detection (RSCD) along with spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF) to detect changes robustly at multiple scales. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss to handle high class imbalance in change detection datasets. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four change detection datasets, Levir-CD, WHU-CD, CLCD, and S2Looking. We achieved 2.5% F1-score improvement on a large complex S2Looking dataset. The code is available at: https://github.com/humza909/SAM-CEM-CD</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Think as Cardiac Sonographers: Marrying SAM with Left Ventricular Indicators Measurements According to Clinical Guidelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08566v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However, VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously. Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers, achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective, optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and indicator measurements.

The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown great effectiveness across various video segmentation tasks. However, its application to offline RVOS is challenged by the translation of the text into effective prompts and a lack of global context awareness. In this paper, we propose a novel RVOS framework, termed MPG-SAM 2, to address these challenges. Specifically, MPG-SAM 2 employs a unified multimodal encoder to jointly encode video and textual features, generating semantically aligned video and text embeddings, along with multimodal class tokens. A mask prior generator utilizes the video embeddings and class tokens to create pseudo masks of target objects and global context. These masks are fed into the prompt encoder as dense prompts along with multimodal class tokens as sparse prompts to generate accurate prompts for SAM 2. To provide the online SAM 2 with a global view, we introduce a hierarchical global-historical aggregator, which allows SAM 2 to aggregate global and historical information of target objects at both pixel and object levels, enhancing the target representation and temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on several RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MPG-SAM 2 and the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative. Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex. Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,recived by ICCV2025</p></details> |
| **[Segment Any Vehicle: Semantic and Visual Context Driven SAM and A Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04260v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception, particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge. Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. % Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released upon acceptance.

Substantial brain lesions in brain imaging exhibit high heterogeneity, with indistinct boundaries between lesion regions and normal brain tissue. Small lesions in single slices are difficult to identify, making the accurate and reproducible segmentation of abnormal regions, as well as their feature description, highly complex. Existing methods have the following limitations: 1) They rely solely on single-modal information for learning, neglecting the multi-modal information commonly used in diagnosis. This hampers the ability to comprehensively acquire brain lesion information from multiple perspectives and prevents the effective integration and utilization of multi-modal data inputs, thereby limiting a holistic understanding of lesions. 2) They are constrained by the amount of data available, leading to low sensitivity to small lesions and difficulty in detecting subtle pathological changes. 3) Current SAM-based models rely on external prompts, which cannot achieve automatic segmentation and, to some extent, affect diagnostic efficiency.To address these issues, we have developed a large-scale fully automated segmentation model specifically designed for brain lesion segmentation, named BrainSegDMLF. This model has the following features: 1) Dynamic Modal Interactive Fusion (DMIF) module that processes and integrates multi-modal data during the encoding process, providing the SAM encoder with more comprehensive modal information. 2) Layer-by-Layer Upsampling Decoder, enabling the model to extract rich low-level and high-level features even with limited data, thereby detecting the presence of small lesions. 3) Automatic segmentation masks, allowing the model to generate lesion masks automatically without requiring manual prompts.</p></details> |  |

Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes, texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts at boundaries of target regions due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we present SAM(a Stability-Aware Manager), an autonomic cache manager that establishes decision stability as a first-class design principle. It achieves this through its core control policy, AURA(Autonomic Utility-balancing Resource Allocator), which resolves the classic exploitation-exploration dilemma by synthesizing two orthogonal factors: the H-factor, representing proven historical efficiency (exploitation), and the V-factor, for estimated marginal gain (exploration). Through this practical synthesis and adaptive control, SAM achieves sustained high performance with strategic stability and robustness in volatile conditions. Extensive experiments against 14 diverse baselines demonstrate SAM's superiority. It achieves top-tier throughput while being uniquely resilient to complex workload shifts and adversarial workloads like cache pollution. Furthermore, its decision latency is highly scalable, remaining nearly constant as the system grows to 120 databases. Crucially, SAM achieves superior decision stability -- maintaining consistent optimization directions despite noise, avoiding performance oscillations while ensuring predictable Quality of Service. These results prove that a principled, stability-aware design is essential for sustained high performance in real-world, large-scale systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures.

However, existing SSCOD methods based on Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically, ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training. Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient SSCOD.

However, the speckle noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight, text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas, TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation, TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS segmentation.

The crucial design of SAM 2 for video segmentation is its memory module, which prompts object-aware memories from previous frames for current frame prediction. However, its greedy-selection memory design suffers from the "error accumulation" problem, where an errored or missed mask will cascade and influence the segmentation of the subsequent frames, which limits the performance of SAM 2 toward complex long-term videos. To this end, we introduce SAM2Long, an improved training-free video object segmentation strategy, which considers the segmentation uncertainty within each frame and chooses the video-level optimal results from multiple segmentation pathways in a constrained tree search manner. In practice, we maintain a fixed number of segmentation pathways throughout the video. For each frame, multiple masks are proposed based on the existing pathways, creating various candidate branches. We then select the same fixed number of branches with higher cumulative scores as the new pathways for the next frame. After processing the final frame, the pathway with the highest cumulative score is chosen as the final segmentation result. Benefiting from its heuristic search design, SAM2Long is robust toward occlusions and object reappearances, and can effectively segment and track objects for complex long-term videos. Notably, SAM2Long achieves an average improvement of 3.0 points across all 24 head-to-head comparisons, with gains of up to 5.3 points in J&F on long-term video object segmentation benchmarks such as SA-V and LVOS.

| **[Fully Automated SAM for Single-source Domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17281v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although SAM-based single-source domain generalization models for medical image segmentation can mitigate the impact of domain shift on the model in cross-domain scenarios, these models still face two major challenges. First, the segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated prompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image segmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second, providing poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large) to the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask results. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain generalization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully automated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted Generation Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty Modeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module integrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty distribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding box prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with SAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image embeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the target object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts.

| **[CMP: A Composable Meta Prompt for SAM-Based Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16753v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) remains challenging due to limited data and domain shifts. Recent foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization capability in general segmentation tasks, making it a promising solution for few-shot scenarios. However, adapting SAM to CD-FSS faces two critical challenges: reliance on manual prompt and limited cross-domain ability. Therefore, we propose the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework that introduces three key modules: (i) the Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for semantic expansion, (ii) the Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (iii) the Frequency-Aware Interaction (FAI) module for domain discrepancy mitigation. Evaluations across four cross-domain datasets demonstrate CMP's state-of-the-art performance, achieving 71.8\% and 74.5\% mIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios respectively.</p></details> | 3 figures |

Additionally, reliance on large-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and error-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong generalizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts, effectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and time-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework based on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated image, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional annotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation (CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to adapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead of dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for iterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality. Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness. Notably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 11.44%.</p></details> | accepted by ICCV2025 |
| **[SAMST: A Transformer framework based on SAM pseudo label filtering for remote sensing semi-supervised semantic segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11994v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Public remote sensing datasets often face limitations in universality due to resolution variability and inconsistent land cover category definitions. To harness the vast pool of unlabeled remote sensing data, we propose SAMST, a semi-supervised semantic segmentation method. SAMST leverages the strengths of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in zero-shot generalization and boundary detection. SAMST iteratively refines pseudo-labels through two main components: supervised model self-training using both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, and a SAM-based Pseudo-label Refiner. The Pseudo-label Refiner comprises three modules: a Threshold Filter Module for preprocessing, a Prompt Generation Module for extracting connected regions and generating prompts for SAM, and a Label Refinement Module for final label stitching. By integrating the generalization power of large models with the training efficiency of small models, SAMST improves pseudo-label accuracy, thereby enhancing overall model performance. Experiments on the Potsdam dataset validate the effectiveness and feasibility of SAMST, demonstrating its potential to address the challenges posed by limited labeled data in remote sensing semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>IGARS...</summary><p>IGARSS2025 accepted, Correspondence: fujianhai2024@gmail.com (J.F.), cuichj@mail2.sysu.edu.cn (C.C.)</p></details> |

While psychological explanations such as the ideomotor effect exist, a computational understanding of how decentralized, implicit linguistic knowledge fuses through shared physical interaction remains elusive. We introduce CoCre-Sam (Collective-Creature Sampling), a framework modeling this phenomenon as collective Langevin dynamics sampling from implicitly fused language models. Each participant is represented as an agent associated with an energy landscape derived from an internal language model reflecting linguistic priors, and agents exert stochastic forces based on local energy gradients. We theoretically prove that the collective motion of the shared pointer (planchette) corresponds to Langevin MCMC sampling from the sum of individual energy landscapes, representing fused collective knowledge. Simulations validate that CoCre-Sam dynamics effectively fuse different models and generate meaningful character sequences, while ablation studies confirm the essential roles of collective interaction and stochasticity. Altogether, CoCre-Sam provides a novel computational mechanism linking individual implicit knowledge, embodied collective action, and emergent linguistic phenomena, grounding these complex interactions in the principles of probabilistic sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compress Any Segment Anything Model (SAM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08765v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing. Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 tables, 8 figures</p></details> |

The recent segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated strong adaptability across diverse natural scenarios. However, the huge computational costs, demand for manual annotations as prompts and conflict-prone decoding process of SAM degrade its generalization capabilities in medical scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a modality-decoupled lightweight SAM for domain-generalized medical image segmentation, named De-LightSAM. Specifically, we first devise a lightweight domain-controllable image encoder (DC-Encoder) that produces discriminative visual features for diverse modalities. Further, we introduce the self-patch prompt generator (SP-Generator) to automatically generate high-quality dense prompt embeddings for guiding segmentation decoding. Finally, we design the query-decoupled modality decoder (QM-Decoder) that leverages a one-to-one strategy to provide an independent decoding channel for every modality, preventing mutual knowledge interference of different modalities. Moreover, we design a multi-modal decoupled knowledge distillation (MDKD) strategy to leverage robust common knowledge to complement domain-specific medical feature representations. Extensive experiments indicate that De-LightSAM outperforms state-of-the-arts in diverse medical imaging segmentation tasks, displaying superior modality universality and generalization capabilities. Especially, De-LightSAM uses only 2.0% parameters compared to SAM-H. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/De-LightSAM.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, 2D specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy, non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18 backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment.

However, accurately segmenting vessels remains challenging due to their small size, intricate edge structures, and susceptibility to artifacts and imaging noise. In this work, we propose VesselSAM, an enhanced version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), specifically tailored for aortic vessel segmentation. VesselSAM incorporates AtrousLoRA, a novel module integrating Atrous Attention and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance segmentation performance. Atrous Attention enables the model to capture multi-scale contextual information, preserving both fine-grained local details and broader global context. Additionally, LoRA facilitates efficient fine-tuning of the frozen SAM image encoder, reducing the number of trainable parameters and thereby enhancing computational efficiency. We evaluate VesselSAM using two challenging datasets: the Aortic Vessel Tree (AVT) dataset and the Type-B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) dataset. VesselSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining DSC scores of 93.50\%, 93.25\%, 93.02\%, and 93.26\% across multi-center datasets. Our results demonstrate that VesselSAM delivers high segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to existing large-scale models. This development paves the way for enhanced AI-based aortic vessel segmentation in clinical environments. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/Adnan-CAS/AtrousLora.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is appealing as it can deal with privacy concerns and access constraints on source-domain data during adaptation to target-domain data. However, SFDA faces challenges such as insufficient supervision in the target domain with unlabeled images. In this work, we propose a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-guided Reliable Pseudo-Labels method for SFDA (SRPL-SFDA) with three key components: 1) Test-Time Tri-branch Intensity Enhancement (T3IE) that not only improves quality of raw pseudo-labels in the target domain, but also leads to SAM-compatible inputs with three channels to better leverage SAM's zero-shot inference ability for refining the pseudo-labels; 2) A reliable pseudo-label selection module that rejects low-quality pseudo-labels based on Consistency of Multiple SAM Outputs (CMSO) under input perturbations with T3IE; and 3) A reliability-aware training procedure in the unlabeled target domain where reliable pseudo-labels are used for supervision and unreliable parts are regularized by entropy minimization. Experiments conducted on two multi-domain medical image segmentation datasets for fetal brain and the prostate respectively demonstrate that: 1) SRPL-SFDA effectively enhances pseudo-label quality in the unlabeled target domain, and improves SFDA performance by leveraging the reliability-aware training; 2) SRPL-SFDA outperformed state-of-the-art SFDA methods, and its performance is close to that of supervised training in the target domain.

| **[SAM-aware Test-time Adaptation for Universal Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05221v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains. Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs. ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1) Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation.

Current monitoring methods involve ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2) temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM) information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations. We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree crown instance segmentation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Self-Prompting SAM: A Prompt-Free Medical Image Segmentation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02854v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is highly effective in natural image segmentation, it requires dependencies on prompts, which limits its applicability to medical imaging where manual prompts are often unavailable. Existing efforts to fine-tune SAM for medical segmentation typically struggle to remove this dependency. We propose Hierarchical Self-Prompting SAM (HSP-SAM), a novel self-prompting framework that enables SAM to achieve strong performance in prompt-free medical image segmentation. Unlike previous self-prompting methods that remain limited to positional prompts similar to vanilla SAM, we are the first to introduce learning abstract prompts during the self-prompting process. This simple and intuitive self-prompting framework achieves superior performance on classic segmentation tasks such as polyp and skin lesion segmentation, while maintaining robustness across diverse medical imaging modalities. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization to unseen datasets, achieving improvements of up to 14.04% over previous state-of-the-art methods on some challenging benchmarks. These results suggest that abstract prompts encapsulate richer and higher-dimensional semantic information compared to positional prompts, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and generalization performance. All models and codes will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, extending these capabilities to videos presents substantial challenges, particularly in ensuring precise and temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. SAM 2 attempts to address this by training a model on massive image and video data from scratch to learn complex spatiotemporal associations, resulting in huge training costs that hinder research and practical deployment. In this paper, we introduce SAM-I2V, an effective image-to-video upgradation method for cultivating a promptable video segmentation (PVS) model. Our approach strategically upgrades the pre-trained SAM to support PVS, significantly reducing training complexity and resource requirements. To achieve this, we introduce three key innovations: (i) an image-to-video feature extraction upgrader built upon SAM's static image encoder to enable spatiotemporal video perception, (ii) a memory filtering strategy that selects the most relevant past frames for more effective utilization of historical information, and (iii) a memory-as-prompt mechanism leveraging object memory to ensure temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves over 90% of SAM 2's performance while using only 0.2% of its training cost. Our work presents a resource-efficient pathway to PVS, lowering barriers for further research in PVS model design and enabling broader applications and advancements in the field.

To address this problem, semantic segmentation methods based on semi-supervised learning with a small number of labeled data have been proposed. For example, one approach is to train a semantic segmentation model using images with annotated labels and pseudo labels. In this approach, the accuracy of the semantic segmentation model depends on the quality of the pseudo labels, and the quality of the pseudo labels depends on the performance of the model to be trained and the amount of data with annotated labels. In this paper, we generate pseudo labels using zero-shot annotation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels using the Unified Dual-Stream Perturbations Approach (UniMatch), and use them as enhanced labels to train a semantic segmentation model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through the experiments using the public datasets: PASCAL and MS COCO.

However, existing approaches typically rely heavily on manually annotated datasets that include explicit reasoning processes, which are costly and time-consuming to produce. Recent advances suggest that reinforcement learning (RL) can endow large models with reasoning capabilities without requiring such reasoning-annotated data. In this paper, we propose SAM-R1, a novel framework that enables multimodal large models to perform fine-grained reasoning in image understanding tasks. Our approach is the first to incorporate fine-grained segmentation settings during the training of multimodal reasoning models. By integrating task-specific, fine-grained rewards with a tailored optimization objective, we further enhance the model's reasoning and segmentation alignment. We also leverage the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a strong and flexible reward provider to guide the learning process. With only 3k training samples, SAM-R1 achieves strong performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in equipping multimodal models with segmentation-oriented reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

In urology, manual segmentation is considered tedious and impractical due to the typically large scale of image databases and the continuous generation of new data. In this study, the potential of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) -- a state-of-the-art deep learning framework -- is investigated for the automation of kidney stone segmentation. The performance of SAM is evaluated in comparison to traditional models, including U-Net, Residual U-Net, and Attention U-Net, which, despite their efficiency, frequently exhibit limitations in generalizing to unseen datasets. The findings highlight SAM's superior adaptability and efficiency. While SAM achieves comparable performance to U-Net on in-distribution data (Accuracy: 97.68 + 3.04; Dice: 97.78 + 2.47; IoU: 95.76 + 4.18), it demonstrates significantly enhanced generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution data, surpassing all U-Net variants by margins of up to 23 percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, conference, MIUA25</p></details> |
| **[Auto-Prompting SAM for Weakly Supervised Landslide Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13426v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised landslide extraction aims to identify landslide regions from remote sensing data using models trained with weak labels, particularly image-level labels. However, it is often challenged by the imprecise boundaries of the extracted objects due to the lack of pixel-wise supervision and the properties of landslide objects. To tackle these issues, we propose a simple yet effective method by auto-prompting the Segment Anything Model (SAM), i.e., APSAM. Instead of depending on high-quality class activation maps (CAMs) for pseudo-labeling or fine-tuning SAM, our method directly yields fine-grained segmentation masks from SAM inference through prompt engineering. Specifically, it adaptively generates hybrid prompts from the CAMs obtained by an object localization network. To provide sufficient information for SAM prompting, an adaptive prompt generation (APG) algorithm is designed to fully leverage the visual patterns of CAMs, enabling the efficient generation of pseudo-masks for landslide extraction. These informative prompts are able to identify the extent of landslide areas (box prompts) and denote the centers of landslide objects (point prompts), guiding SAM in landslide segmentation. Experimental results on high-resolution aerial and satellite datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving improvements of at least 3.0\% in F1 score and 3.69\% in IoU compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

To address this, some methods use the well-learned knowledge of foundation models (e.g., SAM) to simplify the learning process. Recently, SAM 2 has extended SAM by supporting video segmentation, whose class-agnostic matching ability is useful to FSS. A simple idea is to encode support foreground (FG) features as memory, with which query FG features are matched and fused. Unfortunately, the FG objects in different frames of SAM 2's video data are always the same identity, while those in FSS are different identities, i.e., the matching step is incompatible. Therefore, we design Pseudo Prompt Generator to encode pseudo query memory, matching with query features in a compatible way. However, the memories can never be as accurate as the real ones, i.e., they are likely to contain incomplete query FG, and some unexpected query background (BG) features, leading to wrong segmentation. Hence, we further design Iterative Memory Refinement to fuse more query FG features into the memory, and devise a Support-Calibrated Memory Attention to suppress the unexpected query BG features in memory. Extensive experiments have been conducted on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ to validate the effectiveness of our design, e.g., the 1-shot mIoU can be 4.2% better than the best baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICML'25</p></details> |

Correspondingly, this study tackles Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The previous studies declared that SAM is not workable for COD but this study reveals that SAM works if promoted properly, for which we devise a new framework to render point promotions: First, we develop the Promotion Point Targeting Network (PPT-net) to leverage multi-scale features in predicting the probabilities of camouflaged objects' presences at given candidate points over the image. Then, we develop a key point selection (KPS) algorithm to deploy both positive and negative point promotions contrastively to SAM to guide the segmentation. It is the first work to facilitate big model for COD and achieves plausible results experimentally over the existing methods on 3 data sets under 6 metrics. This study demonstrates an off-the-shelf methodology for COD by leveraging SAM, which gains advantage over designing professional models from scratch, not only in performance, but also in turning the problem to a less challenging task, that is, seeking informative but not exactly precise promotions.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we propose Proxy Prompt (PP), auto-generated by leveraging non-target data with a pre-annotated mask. We devise a novel 3-step context-selection strategy for adaptively selecting the most representative contextual information from non-target data via vision mamba and selective maps, empowering the guiding capability of non-target image-mask pairs for segmentation on target image/video data. To reinforce human-model interactions in PP, we further propose a contextual colorization module via a dual-reverse cross-attention to enhance interactions between target features and contextual-embedding with amplifying distinctive features of user-defined object(s). Via extensive evaluations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and yields comparable results with fully-trained models, even when trained with only 16 image masks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pro2SAM: Mask Prompt to SAM with Grid Points for Weakly Supervised Object Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04905v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL), which aims to localize objects by only using image-level labels, has attracted much attention because of its low annotation cost in real applications. Current studies focus on the Class Activation Map (CAM) of CNN and the self-attention map of transformer to identify the region of objects. However, both CAM and self-attention maps can not learn pixel-level fine-grained information on the foreground objects, which hinders the further advance of WSOL. To address this problem, we initiatively leverage the capability of zero-shot generalization and fine-grained segmentation in Segment Anything Model (SAM) to boost the activation of integral object regions. Further, to alleviate the semantic ambiguity issue accrued in single point prompt-based SAM, we propose an innovative mask prompt to SAM (Pro2SAM) network with grid points for WSOL task. First, we devise a Global Token Transformer (GTFormer) to generate a coarse-grained foreground map as a flexible mask prompt, where the GTFormer jointly embeds patch tokens and novel global tokens to learn foreground semantics. Secondly, we deliver grid points as dense prompts into SAM to maximize the probability of foreground mask, which avoids the lack of objects caused by a single point/box prompt. Finally, we propose a pixel-level similarity metric to come true the mask matching from mask prompt to SAM, where the mask with the highest score is viewed as the final localization map. Experiments show that the proposed Pro2SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC, with 84.03\% and 66.85\% Top-1 Loc, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Recent advancements in foundation models for video object segmentation, such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), offer a potential opportunity to significantly speed up the annotation process by manually annotating one or a few slices and then propagating target masks across the entire volume. However, the performance of SAM 2 in this context varies. Our experiments show that relying on a single memory bank and attention module is prone to error propagation, particularly at boundary regions where the target is present in the previous slice but absent in the current one. To address this problem, we propose Short-Long Memory SAM 2 (SLM-SAM 2), a novel architecture that integrates distinct short-term and long-term memory banks with separate attention modules to improve segmentation accuracy. We evaluate SLM-SAM 2 on three public datasets covering organs, bones, and muscles across MRI and CT modalities. We show that the proposed method markedly outperforms the default SAM 2, achieving average Dice Similarity Coefficient improvement of 0.14 and 0.11 in the scenarios when 5 volumes and 1 volume are available for the initial adaptation, respectively. SLM-SAM 2 also exhibits stronger resistance to over-propagation, making a notable step toward more accurate automated annotation of medical images for segmentation model development.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces SAM-TIFF, a novel teacher-student distillation framework for pixel-level wildfire temperature prediction and segmentation using RGB input only. A multimodal teacher network trained on paired RGB-Thermal imagery and radiometric TIFF ground truth distills knowledge to a unimodal RGB student network, enabling thermal-sensor-free inference. Segmentation supervision is generated using a hybrid approach of segment anything (SAM)-guided mask generation, and selection via TOPSIS, along with Canny edge detection and Otsu's thresholding pipeline for automatic point prompt selection. Our method is the first to perform per-pixel temperature regression from RGB UAV data, demonstrating strong generalization on the recent FLAME 3 dataset. This work lays the foundation for lightweight, cost-effective UAV-based wildfire monitoring systems without thermal sensors.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, its performance in the field of image manipulation detection remains largely unexplored and unconfirmed. There are two main challenges in applying SAM to image manipulation detection: a) reliance on manual prompts, and b) the difficulty of single-view information in supporting cross-dataset generalization. To address these challenges, we develops a cross-view prompt learning paradigm called IMDPrompter based on SAM. Benefiting from the design of automated prompts, IMDPrompter no longer relies on manual guidance, enabling automated detection and localization. Additionally, we propose components such as Cross-view Feature Perception, Optimal Prompt Selection, and Cross-View Prompt Consistency, which facilitate cross-view perceptual learning and guide SAM to generate accurate masks. Extensive experimental results from five datasets (CASIA, Columbia, Coverage, IMD2020, and NIST16) validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM-Guided Robust Representation Learning for One-Shot 3D Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20501v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-shot medical image segmentation (MIS) is crucial for medical analysis due to the burden of medical experts on manual annotation. The recent emergence of the segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable adaptation in MIS but cannot be directly applied to one-shot medical image segmentation (MIS) due to its reliance on labor-intensive user interactions and the high computational cost. To cope with these limitations, we propose a novel SAM-guided robust representation learning framework, named RRL-MedSAM, to adapt SAM to one-shot 3D MIS, which exploits the strong generalization capabilities of the SAM encoder to learn better feature representation. We devise a dual-stage knowledge distillation (DSKD) strategy to distill general knowledge between natural and medical images from the foundation model to train a lightweight encoder, and then adopt a mutual exponential moving average (mutual-EMA) to update the weights of the general lightweight encoder and medical-specific encoder. Specifically, pseudo labels from the registration network are used to perform mutual supervision for such two encoders. Moreover, we introduce an auto-prompting (AP) segmentation decoder which adopts the mask generated from the general lightweight model as a prompt to assist the medical-specific model in boosting the final segmentation performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets, i.e., OASIS, CT-lung demonstrate that the proposed RRL-MedSAM outperforms state-of-the-art one-shot MIS methods for both segmentation and registration tasks. Especially, our lightweight encoder uses only 3\% of the parameters compared to the encoder of SAM-Base.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Tuning SAM: From Generalist to Specialist with only 2048 Parameters and 16 Training Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16739v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is widely used for segmenting a diverse range of objects in natural images from simple user prompts like points or bounding boxes. However, SAM's performance decreases substantially when applied to non-natural domains like microscopic imaging. Furthermore, due to SAM's interactive design, it requires a precise prompt for each image and object, which is unfeasible in many automated biomedical applications. Previous solutions adapt SAM by training millions of parameters via fine-tuning large parts of the model or of adapter layers. In contrast, we show that as little as 2,048 additional parameters are sufficient for turning SAM into a use-case specialist for a certain downstream task. Our novel PTSAM (prompt-tuned SAM) method uses prompt-tuning, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, to adapt SAM for a specific task. We validate the performance of our approach on multiple microscopic and one medical dataset. Our results show that prompt-tuning only SAM's mask decoder already leads to a performance on-par with state-of-the-art techniques while requiring roughly 2,000x less trainable parameters. For addressing domain gaps, we find that additionally prompt-tuning SAM's image encoder is beneficial, further improving segmentation accuracy by up to 18% over state-of-the-art results. Since PTSAM can be reliably trained with as little as 16 annotated images, we find it particularly helpful for applications with limited training data and domain shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable Adversarial Attacks on SAM and Its Downstream Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20197v3)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The utilization of large foundational models has a dilemma: while fine-tuning downstream tasks from them holds promise for making use of the well-generalized knowledge in practical applications, their open accessibility also poses threats of adverse usage. This paper, for the first time, explores the feasibility of adversarial attacking various downstream models fine-tuned from the segment anything model (SAM), by solely utilizing the information from the open-sourced SAM. In contrast to prevailing transfer-based adversarial attacks, we demonstrate the existence of adversarial dangers even without accessing the downstream task and dataset to train a similar surrogate model. To enhance the effectiveness of the adversarial attack towards models fine-tuned on unknown datasets, we propose a universal meta-initialization (UMI) algorithm to extract the intrinsic vulnerability inherent in the foundation model, which is then utilized as the prior knowledge to guide the generation of adversarial perturbations. Moreover, by formulating the gradient difference in the attacking process between the open-sourced SAM and its fine-tuned downstream models, we theoretically demonstrate that a deviation occurs in the adversarial update direction by directly maximizing the distance of encoded feature embeddings in the open-sourced SAM. Consequently, we propose a gradient robust loss that simulates the associated uncertainty with gradient-based noise augmentation to enhance the robustness of generated adversarial examples (AEs) towards this deviation, thus improving the transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed universal meta-initialized and gradient robust adversarial attack (UMI-GRAT) toward SAMs and their downstream models.

| **[SAUGE: Taming SAM for Uncertainty-Aligned Multi-Granularity Edge Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12892v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge labels are typically at various granularity levels owing to the varying preferences of annotators, thus handling the subjectivity of per-pixel labels has been a focal point for edge detection. Previous methods often employ a simple voting strategy to diminish such label uncertainty or impose a strong assumption of labels with a pre-defined distribution, e.g., Gaussian. In this work, we unveil that the segment anything model (SAM) provides strong prior knowledge to model the uncertainty in edge labels. Our key insight is that the intermediate SAM features inherently correspond to object edges at various granularities, which reflects different edge options due to uncertainty. Therefore, we attempt to align uncertainty with granularity by regressing intermediate SAM features from different layers to object edges at multi-granularity levels. In doing so, the model can fully and explicitly explore diverse ``uncertainties'' in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, we inject a lightweight module (~ 1.5% additional parameters) into the frozen SAM to progressively fuse and adapt its intermediate features to estimate edges from coarse to fine. It is crucial to normalize the granularity level of human edge labels to match their innate uncertainty. For this, we simply perform linear blending to the real edge labels at hand to create pseudo labels with varying granularities. Consequently, our uncertainty-aligned edge detector can flexibly produce edges at any desired granularity (including an optimal one). Thanks to SAM, our model uniquely demonstrates strong generalizability for cross-dataset edge detection. Extensive experimental results on BSDS500, Muticue and NYUDv2 validate our model's superiority.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[SAM-Based Building Change Detection with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and Edge-Constrained Warping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12619v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building change detection remains challenging for urban development, disaster assessment, and military reconnaissance. While foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) show strong segmentation capabilities, SAM is limited in the task of building change detection due to domain gap issues. Existing adapter-based fine-tuning approaches face challenges with imbalanced building distribution, resulting in poor detection of subtle changes and inaccurate edge extraction. Additionally, bi-temporal misalignment in change detection, typically addressed by optical flow, remains vulnerable to background noises. This affects the detection of building changes and compromises both detection accuracy and edge recognition. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new SAM-Based Network with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and Edge-Constrained Warping (FAEWNet) for building change detection. FAEWNet utilizes the SAM encoder to extract rich visual features from remote sensing images. To guide SAM in focusing on specific ground objects in remote sensing scenes, we propose a Distribution-Aware Fourier Aggregated Adapter to aggregate task-oriented changed information. This adapter not only effectively addresses the domain gap issue, but also pays attention to the distribution of changed buildings. Furthermore, to mitigate noise interference and misalignment in height offset estimation, we design a novel flow module that refines building edge extraction and enhances the perception of changed buildings. Our state-of-the-art results on the LEVIR-CD, S2Looking and WHU-CD datasets highlight the effectiveness of FAEWNet. The code is available at https://github.com/SUPERMAN123000/FAEWNet.</p></details> |  |

One promising strategy for SDG is to leverage consistent semantic shape priors across different imaging protocols, scanner vendors, and clinical sites. However, existing dictionary learning methods that encode shape priors often suffer from limited representational power with a small set of offline computed shape elements, or overfitting when the dictionary size grows. Moreover, they are not readily compatible with large foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM). In this paper, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Shape-Experts (MoSE) framework that seamlessly integrates the idea of mixture-of-experts (MoE) training into dictionary learning to efficiently capture diverse and robust shape priors. Our method conceptualizes each dictionary atom as a shape expert, which specializes in encoding distinct semantic shape information. A gating network dynamically fuses these shape experts into a robust shape map, with sparse activation guided by SAM encoding to prevent overfitting. We further provide this shape map as a prompt to SAM, utilizing the powerful generalization capability of SAM through bidirectional integration. All modules, including the shape dictionary, are trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 workshop</p></details> |

This paper presents SAM-CP, a simple approach that establishes two types of composable prompts beyond SAM and composes them for versatile segmentation. Specifically, given a set of classes (in texts) and a set of SAM patches, the Type-I prompt judges whether a SAM patch aligns with a text label, and the Type-II prompt judges whether two SAM patches with the same text label also belong to the same instance. To decrease the complexity in dealing with a large number of semantic classes and patches, we establish a unified framework that calculates the affinity between (semantic and instance) queries and SAM patches and merges patches with high affinity to the query. Experiments show that SAM-CP achieves semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation in both open and closed domains. In particular, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary segmentation. Our research offers a novel and generalized methodology for equipping vision foundation models like SAM with multi-grained semantic perception abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025; codes:https://github.com/ucas-vg/SAM-CP</p></details> |

Open-vocabulary image Segmentation addresses these generalization issues in traditional supervised segmentation models while reducing reliance on extensive per-pixel annotations, which are both expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. Most Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) methods are designed for natural images but struggle with remote sensing data due to scale variations, orientation changes, and complex scene compositions. This necessitates the development of OVS approaches specifically tailored for remote sensing. In this context, we propose AerOSeg, a novel OVS approach for remote sensing data. First, we compute robust image-text correlation features using multiple rotated versions of the input image and domain-specific prompts. These features are then refined through spatial and class refinement blocks. Inspired by the success of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in diverse domains, we leverage SAM features to guide the spatial refinement of correlation features. Additionally, we introduce a semantic back-projection module and loss to ensure the seamless propagation of SAM's semantic information throughout the segmentation pipeline. Finally, we enhance the refined correlation features using a multi-scale attention-aware decoder to produce the final segmentation map. We validate our SAM-guided Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Segmentation model on three benchmark remote sensing datasets: iSAID, DLRSD, and OpenEarthMap. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.54 h-mIoU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EarthVision workshop, CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Given SAM's wide applications, understanding its robustness against adversarial attacks is crucial for real-world deployment. However, research on SAM's robustness is still in its early stages. Existing attacks often overlook the role of prompts in evaluating SAM's robustness, and there has been insufficient exploration of defense methods to balance the robustness and accuracy. To address these gaps, this paper proposes an adversarial robustness framework designed to evaluate and enhance the robustness of SAM. Specifically, we introduce a cross-prompt attack method to enhance the attack transferability across different prompt types. Besides attacking, we propose a few-parameter adaptation strategy to defend SAM against various adversarial attacks. To balance robustness and accuracy, we use the singular value decomposition (SVD) to constrain the space of trainable parameters, where only singular values are adaptable. Experiments demonstrate that our cross-prompt attack method outperforms previous approaches in terms of attack success rate on both SAM and SAM 2. By adapting only 512 parameters, we achieve at least a 15\% improvement in mean intersection over union (mIoU) against various adversarial attacks. Compared to previous defense methods, our approach enhances the robustness of SAM while maximally maintaining its original performance.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

Current teacher-student frameworks still suffer from performance constraints due to unreliable pseudo-label quality stemming from limited labeled data. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers robust segmentation capabilities at various granularities, directly applying SAM to this task introduces challenges such as class-agnostic predictions and potential over-segmentation. To address these complexities, we carefully integrate SAM into the semi-supervised instance segmentation framework, developing a novel distillation method that effectively captures the precise localization capabilities of SAM without compromising semantic recognition. Furthermore, we incorporate pseudo-label refinement as well as a specialized data augmentation with the refined pseudo-labels, resulting in superior performance. We establish state-of-the-art performance, and provide comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches in image manipulation detection have largely been driven by fully supervised approaches, which require labor-intensive pixel-level annotations. Thus, it is essential to explore weakly supervised image manipulation localization methods that only require image-level binary labels for training. However, existing weakly supervised image manipulation methods overlook the importance of edge information for accurate localization, leading to suboptimal localization performance. To address this, we propose a Context-Aware Boundary Localization (CABL) module to aggregate boundary features and learn context-inconsistency for localizing manipulated areas. Furthermore, by leveraging Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and Segment Anything Model (SAM), we introduce the CAM-Guided SAM Refinement (CGSR) module to generate more accurate manipulation localization maps. By integrating two modules, we present a novel weakly supervised framework based on a dual-branch Transformer-CNN architecture. Our method achieves outstanding localization performance across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective SAM Combination for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14723v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign pixel-level labels to images across an unlimited range of classes. Traditional methods address this by sequentially connecting a powerful mask proposal generator, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP. But these two-stage approaches often suffer from high computational costs, memory inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose ESC-Net, a novel one-stage open-vocabulary segmentation model that leverages the SAM decoder blocks for class-agnostic segmentation within an efficient inference framework. By embedding pseudo prompts generated from image-text correlations into SAM's promptable segmentation framework, ESC-Net achieves refined spatial aggregation for accurate mask predictions. ESC-Net achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks, including ADE20K, PASCAL-VOC, and PASCAL-Context, outperforming prior methods in both efficiency and accuracy.

However, although SAM excels in fine-grained segmentation, it faces major challenges when applying it to semantic-aware segmentation. While CLIP exhibits a strong semantic understanding capability via aligning the global features of language and vision, it has deficiencies in fine-grained segmentation tasks. Human parsing requires to segment human bodies into constituent parts and involves both accurate fine-grained segmentation and high semantic understanding of each part. Based on traits of SAM and CLIP, we formulate high efficient modules to effectively integrate features of them to benefit human parsing. We propose a Semantic-Refinement Module to integrate semantic features of CLIP with SAM features to benefit parsing. Moreover, we formulate a high efficient Fine-tuning Module to adjust the pretrained SAM for human parsing that needs high semantic information and simultaneously demands spatial details, which significantly reduces the training time compared with full-time training and achieves notable performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on LIP, PPP, and CIHP databases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving SAM for Camouflaged Object Detection via Dual Stream Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06042v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment anything model (SAM) has shown impressive general-purpose segmentation performance on natural images, but its performance on camouflaged object detection (COD) is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose SAM-COD that performs camouflaged object detection for RGB-D inputs. While keeping the SAM architecture intact, dual stream adapters are expanded on the image encoder to learn potential complementary information from RGB images and depth images, and fine-tune the mask decoder and its depth replica to perform dual-stream mask prediction. In practice, the dual stream adapters are embedded into the attention block of the image encoder in a parallel manner to facilitate the refinement and correction of the two types of image embeddings. To mitigate channel discrepancies arising from dual stream embeddings that do not directly interact with each other, we augment the association of dual stream embeddings using bidirectional knowledge distillation including a model distiller and a modal distiller. In addition, to predict the masks for RGB and depth attention maps, we hybridize the two types of image embeddings which are jointly learned with the prompt embeddings to update the initial prompt, and then feed them into the mask decoders to synchronize the consistency of image embeddings and prompt embeddings. Experimental results on four COD benchmarks show that our SAM-COD achieves excellent detection performance gains over SAM and achieves state-of-the-art results with a given fine-tuning paradigm.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods address this issue through modality fusion, integrating textual and image information to provide more detailed priors. In this study, we argue that the granularity of text and the domain gap affect the accuracy of the priors. Furthermore, the discrepancy between high-level abstract semantics and pixel-level boundary details in images can introduce noise into the fusion process. To address this, we propose Prior-Guided SAM (PG-SAM), which employs a fine-grained modality prior aligner to leverage specialized medical knowledge for better modality alignment. The core of our method lies in efficiently addressing the domain gap with fine-grained text from a medical LLM. Meanwhile, it also enhances the priors' quality after modality alignment, ensuring more accurate segmentation. In addition, our decoder enhances the model's expressive capabilities through multi-level feature fusion and iterative mask optimizer operations, supporting unprompted learning. We also propose a unified pipeline that effectively supplies high-quality semantic information to SAM. Extensive experiments on the Synapse dataset demonstrate that the proposed PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Current monitoring methods involve measuring trees by hand for each species, requiring extensive cost, time, and labour. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping and characterizing trees from aerial imagery, and large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), may be a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare SAM methods for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery of young tree plantations. We explore the potential of SAM for this task, and find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts, but that there is potential for methods which tune SAM further.

Although early research prioritized visual quality, preserving fine details and adapting to downstream tasks remains challenging. Recent approaches attempt task-specific design but rarely achieve "The Best of Both Worlds" due to inconsistent optimization goals. To address these issues, we propose a novel method that leverages the semantic knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to Grow the quality of fusion results and Enable downstream task adaptability, namely SAGE. Specifically, we design a Semantic Persistent Attention (SPA) Module that efficiently maintains source information via the persistent repository while extracting high-level semantic priors from SAM. More importantly, to eliminate the impractical dependence on SAM during inference, we introduce a bi-level optimization-driven distillation mechanism with triplet losses, which allow the student network to effectively extract knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a balance between high-quality visual results and downstream task adaptability while maintaining practical deployment efficiency.

However, SAM does not work when directly applied to medical image segmentation, since SAM lacks the ability to predict semantic labels, requires additional prompts, and presents suboptimal performance. Following the above issues, we propose MaskSAM, a novel mask classification prompt-free SAM adaptation framework for medical image segmentation. We design a prompt generator combined with the image encoder in SAM to generate a set of auxiliary classifier tokens, auxiliary binary masks, and auxiliary bounding boxes. Each pair of auxiliary mask and box prompts can solve the requirements of extra prompts. The semantic label prediction can be addressed by the sum of the auxiliary classifier tokens and the learnable global classifier tokens in the mask decoder of SAM. Meanwhile, we design a 3D depth-convolution adapter for image embeddings and a 3D depth-MLP adapter for prompt embeddings to efficiently fine-tune SAM. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AMOS2022, 90.52% Dice, which improved by 2.7% compared to nnUNet.

Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has shown superior advancements in image and video segmentation. However, SAM2 struggles with efficiency due to the high computational demands of processing high-resolution images and complex and long-range temporal dynamics in surgical videos. To address these challenges, we introduce Surgical SAM 2 (SurgSAM2), an advanced model to utilize SAM2 with an Efficient Frame Pruning (EFP) mechanism, to facilitate real-time surgical video segmentation. The EFP mechanism dynamically manages the memory bank by selectively retaining only the most informative frames, reducing memory usage and computational cost while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgSAM2 significantly improves both efficiency and segmentation accuracy compared to the vanilla SAM2. Remarkably, SurgSAM2 achieves a 3$\times$ FPS compared with SAM2, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance after fine-tuning with lower-resolution data. These advancements establish SurgSAM2 as a leading model for surgical video analysis, making real-time surgical video segmentation in resource-constrained environments a reality.

Currently, several recent works have utilized the segmenting anything model (SAM) to boost the segmentation performance in medical images, where most of them focus on training an adaptor for fine-tuning a large amount of pixel-wise annotated medical images following a fully supervised manner. In this paper, to reduce the labeling cost, we investigate a novel weakly-supervised SAM-based segmentation model, namely WeakMedSAM. Specifically, our proposed WeakMedSAM contains two modules: 1) to mitigate severe co-occurrence in medical images, a sub-class exploration module is introduced to learn accurate feature representations. 2) to improve the quality of the class activation maps, our prompt affinity mining module utilizes the prompt capability of SAM to obtain an affinity map for random-walk refinement. Our method can be applied to any SAM-like backbone, and we conduct experiments with SAMUS and EfficientSAM. The experimental results on three popularly-used benchmark datasets, i.e., BraTS 2019, AbdomenCT-1K, and MSD Cardiac dataset, show the promising results of our proposed WeakMedSAM.

However, current scribble-supervised learning methods are limited in their ability to effectively propagate sparse annotation labels to dense segmentation masks and accurately segment object boundaries. To address these issues, we propose a Progressive Collaborative Learning framework that leverages novel algorithms and the Med-SAM foundation model to enhance information quality during training. (1) We enrich ground truth scribble segmentation labels through a new algorithm, propagating scribbles to estimate object boundaries. (2) We enhance feature representation by optimizing Med-SAM-guided training through the fusion of feature embeddings from Med-SAM and our proposed Sparse Mamba network. This enriched representation also facilitates the fine-tuning of the Med-SAM decoder with enriched scribbles. (3) For inference, we introduce a Sparse Mamba network, which is highly capable of capturing local and global dependencies by replacing the traditional sequential patch processing method with a skip-sampling procedure. Experiments on the ACDC, CHAOS, and MSCMRSeg datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, outperforming nine state-of-the-art methods.

This can make the model selection process slow, non-extensive and highly subjective, while producing unrealistic looking parameter estimates with discrete jumps. We propose to model age-dependent SAM parameters using smoothing spline functions. This can lead to more smooth parameter estimates, while speeding up and making the model selection process more automatic and less subjective. We develop different spline models and compare them with already existing SAM models for a selection of 17 different fish stocks, using cross- and forward-validation methods. The results show that our automated spline models overall outcompete the officially developed SAM models. We also demonstrate how the developed spline models can be employed as a diagnostics tool for improving and better understanding properties of the officially developed SAM models.</p></details> |  |

The approach integrates two advanced AI models, CLIP and SAM, focusing on their synergistic combination and the effective use of multimodal data (image and text). Emphasis is placed on utilizing gradient-based attention mechanisms and customized datasets to fine-tune performance. While CLIP, SAM, and Grad- CAM are established components, their integration within this structured pipeline represents a significant contribution to the field. The resulting segmented masks, generated through this combined approach, can be effectively utilized as inputs for robotic systems, enabling more precise and adaptive object manipulation in the context of convenience store products.</p></details> |  |
| **[LORENZA: Enhancing Generalization in Low-Rank Gradient LLM Training via Efficient Zeroth-Order Adaptive SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19571v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study robust parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques designed to improve accuracy and generalization while operating within strict computational and memory hardware constraints, specifically focusing on large-language models (LLMs). Existing PEFT methods often lack robustness and fail to generalize effectively across diverse tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. To address this, we present a new highly computationally efficient framework called AdaZo-SAM, combining Adam and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) while requiring only a single-gradient computation in every iteration. This is achieved using a stochastic zeroth-order estimation to find SAM's ascent perturbation. We provide a convergence guarantee for AdaZo-SAM and show that it improves the generalization ability of state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Additionally, we design a low-rank gradient optimization method named LORENZA, which is a memory-efficient version of AdaZo-SAM. LORENZA utilizes a randomized SVD scheme to efficiently compute the subspace projection matrix and apply optimization steps onto the selected subspace. This technique enables full-parameter fine-tuning with adaptive low-rank gradient updates, achieving the same reduced memory consumption as gradient-low-rank-projection methods. We provide a convergence analysis of LORENZA and demonstrate its merits for pre-training and fine-tuning LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monge SAM: Robust Reparameterization-Invariant Sharpness-Aware Minimization Based on Loss Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08448v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on deep neural networks show that flat minima of the loss landscape correlate with improved generalization. Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) efficiently finds flat regions by updating the parameters according to the gradient at an adversarial perturbation. The perturbation depends on the Euclidean metric, making SAM non-invariant under reparametrizations, which blurs sharpness and generalization. We propose Monge SAM (M-SAM), a reparametrization invariant version of SAM by considering a Riemannian metric in the parameter space induced naturally by the loss surface. Compared to previous approaches, M-SAM works under any modeling choice, relies only on mild assumptions while being as computationally efficient as SAM. We theoretically argue that M-SAM varies between SAM and gradient descent (GD), which increases robustness to hyperparameter selection and reduces attraction to suboptimal equilibria like saddle points. We demonstrate this behavior both theoretically and empirically on a multi-modal representation alignment task.</p></details> |  |

Building on SAM's success in medical image segmentation, SAM 2 presents significant potential for further advancement. However, similar to SAM, SAM 2 is limited by its output of binary masks, inability to infer semantic labels, and dependence on precise prompts for the target object area. Additionally, direct application of SAM and SAM 2 to medical image segmentation tasks yields suboptimal results. In this paper, we explore the upper performance limit of SAM 2 using custom fine-tuning adapters, achieving a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 92.30% on the BTCV dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art nnUNet by 12%. Following this, we address the prompt dependency by investigating various prompt generators. We introduce a UNet to autonomously generate predicted masks and bounding boxes, which serve as input to SAM 2. Subsequent dual-stage refinements by SAM 2 further enhance performance. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the AMOS2022 dataset, with a Dice improvement of 2.9% compared to nnUNet, and outperforms nnUNet by 6.4% on the BTCV dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Avoiding spurious sharpness minimization broadens applicability of SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02407v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvature regularization techniques like Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) have shown great promise in improving generalization on vision tasks. However, we find that SAM performs poorly in domains like natural language processing (NLP), often degrading performance -- even with twice the compute budget. We investigate the discrepancy across domains and find that in the NLP setting, SAM is dominated by regularization of the logit statistics -- instead of improving the geometry of the function itself. We use this observation to develop an alternative algorithm we call Functional-SAM, which regularizes curvature only through modification of the statistics of the overall function implemented by the neural network, and avoids spurious minimization through logit manipulation. Furthermore, we argue that preconditioning the SAM perturbation also prevents spurious minimization, and when combined with Functional-SAM, it gives further improvements. Our proposed algorithms show improved performance over AdamW and SAM baselines when trained for an equal number of steps, in both fixed-length and Chinchilla-style training settings, at various model scales (including billion-parameter scale). On the whole, our work highlights the importance of more precise characterizations of sharpness in broadening the applicability of curvature regularization to large language models (LLMs).</p></details> |  |

Given the 3D point cloud and multiple posed RGB-D frames of 3D scenes, our approach segments 3D instances by applying the pretrained Segment Anything Model (SAM) to 2D frames. Our key idea involves locating SAM prompts in 3D to align their projected pixel prompts across frames, ensuring the view consistency of SAM-predicted masks. Moreover, we suggest selecting prompts from the initial set guided by the information of SAM-predicted masks across all views, which enhances the overall performance. We further propose to consolidate different prompts if they are segmenting different surface parts of the same 3D instance, bringing a more comprehensive segmentation. Notably, our method does not require any additional training. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that our method achieves comparable or better performance compared to previous zero-shot or fully supervised approaches, and in many cases surpasses human annotations. Furthermore, since our fine-grained predictions often lack annotations in available datasets, we present ScanNet200-Fine50 test data which provides fine-grained annotations on 50 scenes from ScanNet200 dataset.

This paper presents Synthetic Anomaly Monitoring (SAM), an innovative approach that applies synthetic control methods from causal inference to improve both the accuracy and interpretability of anomaly detection processes. By modeling normal behavior through the treatment of each feature as a control unit, SAM identifies anomalies as deviations within this causal framework. We conducted extensive experiments comparing SAM with established benchmark models, including Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), across five diverse datasets, including Credit Card Fraud, HTTP Dataset CSIC 2010, and KDD Cup 1999, among others.

To effectively deploy these models in real-world scenarios, it is essential to employ cross-domain adaptation techniques that bridge the gap between training data and real-world data. Recently, self-training with pseudo-labels has emerged as a predominant method for cross-domain adaptation in multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation. However, generating reliable pseudo-labels necessitates stringent constraints, which often result in sparse pseudo-labels after pruning. This sparsity can potentially hinder performance improvement during the adaptation process. We propose an image-guided pseudo-label enhancement approach that leverages the complementary 2D prior knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to introduce more reliable pseudo-labels, thereby boosting domain adaptation performance. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and the SAM masks from its paired image data, we collect all 3D points covered by each SAM mask that potentially belong to the same object. Then our method refines the pseudo-labels within each SAM mask in two steps. First, we determine the class label for each mask using majority voting and employ various constraints to filter out unreliable mask labels. Next, we introduce Geometry-Aware Progressive Propagation (GAPP) which propagates the mask label to all 3D points within the SAM mask while avoiding outliers caused by 2D-3D misalignment. Experiments conducted across multiple datasets and domain adaptation scenarios demonstrate that our proposed method significantly increases the quantity of high-quality pseudo-labels and enhances the adaptation performance over baseline methods.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[Vision and Language Reference Prompt into SAM for Few-shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00719v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a large-scale segmentation model that enables powerful zero-shot capabilities with flexible prompts. While SAM can segment any object in zero-shot, it requires user-provided prompts for each target image and does not attach any label information to masks. Few-shot segmentation models addressed these issues by inputting annotated reference images as prompts to SAM and can segment specific objects in target images without user-provided prompts. Previous SAM-based few-shot segmentation models only use annotated reference images as prompts, resulting in limited accuracy due to a lack of reference information. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot segmentation model, Vision and Language reference Prompt into SAM (VLP-SAM), that utilizes the visual information of the reference images and the semantic information of the text labels by inputting not only images but also language as reference information. In particular, VLP-SAM is a simple and scalable structure with minimal learnable parameters, which inputs prompt embeddings with vision-language information into SAM using a multimodal vision-language model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of VLP-SAM, we conducted experiments on the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets, and achieved high performance in the few-shot segmentation task, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art model by a large margin (6.3% and 9.5% in mIoU, respectively). Furthermore, VLP-SAM demonstrates its generality in unseen objects that are not included in the training data. Our code is available at https://github.com/kosukesakurai1/VLP-SAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Self-Prompt SAM: Medical Image Segmentation via Automatic Prompt SAM Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00630v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance and brought a range of unexplored capabilities to natural image segmentation tasks. However, as a very important branch of image segmentation, the performance of SAM remains uncertain when applied to medical image segmentation due to the significant differences between natural images and medical images. Meanwhile, it is harsh to meet the SAM's requirements of extra prompts provided, such as points or boxes to specify medical regions. In this paper, we propose a novel self-prompt SAM adaptation framework for medical image segmentation, named Self-Prompt-SAM. We design a multi-scale prompt generator combined with the image encoder in SAM to generate auxiliary masks. Then, we use the auxiliary masks to generate bounding boxes as box prompts and use Distance Transform to select the most central points as point prompts. Meanwhile, we design a 3D depth-fused adapter (DfusedAdapter) and inject the DFusedAdapter into each transformer in the image encoder and mask decoder to enable pre-trained 2D SAM models to extract 3D information and adapt to 3D medical images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms nnUNet by 2.3% on AMOS2022, 1.6% on ACDCand 0.5% on Synapse datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, its significant computational requirements limit its deployment in real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel knowledge distillation approach, KD SAM, which incorporates both encoder and decoder optimization through a combination of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Perceptual Loss. This dual-loss framework captures structural and semantic features, enabling the student model to maintain high segmentation accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Based on the model evaluation on datasets, including Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2017, Fetal Head Ultrasound, and Breast Ultrasound, we demonstrate that KD SAM achieves comparable or superior performance to the baseline models, with significantly fewer parameters. KD SAM effectively balances segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time medical image segmentation applications in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Unsupervised segmentation is promising to avoid human annotations while the performance is often limited. In this study, we present a novel unsupervised segmentation approach that leverages the capabilities of foundation models, and it consists of three main steps: (1) A vision-language model (i.e., CLIP) is employed to obtain image-level pseudo-labels for training a classification network. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) is then employed to extract Regions of Interest (ROIs), where an adaptive masking-based data augmentation is used to enhance ROI identification.(2) The ROIs are used to generate bounding box and point prompts for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain segmentation pseudo-labels. (3) A 3D segmentation network is trained with the SAM-derived pseudo-labels, where low-quality pseudo-labels are filtered out in a self-learning process based on the similarity between the SAM's output and the network's prediction. Evaluation on the BraTS2020 dataset demonstrates that our approach obtained an average Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 85.60%, outperforming five state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods by more than 10 percentage points. Besides, our approach outperforms directly using SAM for zero-shot inference, and its performance is close to fully supervised learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>22st ...</summary><p>22st IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2025)</p></details> |

To reduce the annotation cost and maintain satisfactory performance, in this work, we leverage the capabilities of SAM for establishing semi-supervised medical image segmentation models. Rethinking the requirements of effectiveness, efficiency, and compatibility, we propose a three-stage framework, i.e., Stitching, Fine-tuning, and Re-training (SFR). The current fine-tuning approaches mostly involve 2D slice-wise fine-tuning that disregards the contextual information between adjacent slices. Our stitching strategy mitigates the mismatch between natural and 3D medical images. The stitched images are then used for fine-tuning SAM, providing robust initialization of pseudo-labels. Afterwards, we train a 3D semi-supervised segmentation model while maintaining the same parameter size as the conventional segmenter such as V-Net. Our SFR framework is plug-and-play, and easily compatible with various popular semi-supervised methods. We also develop an extended framework SFR$^+$ with selective fine-tuning and re-training through confidence estimation. Extensive experiments validate that our SFR and SFR$^+$ achieve significant improvements in both moderate annotation and scarce annotation across five datasets. In particular, SFR framework improves the Dice score of Mean Teacher from 29.68% to 74.40% with only one labeled data of LA dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, unlike traditional vision tasks, skin images in general present unique challenges due to the limited availability of well-annotated datasets, complex variations in conditions, and the necessity for detailed interpretations to ensure patient safety. Previous segmentation methods have sought to reduce image noise and enhance diagnostic performance, but these techniques require fine-grained, pixel-level ground truth masks for training. In contrast, with the rise of foundation models, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has been introduced to facilitate promptable segmentation, enabling the automation of the segmentation process with simple yet effective prompts. Efforts applying SAM predominantly focus on dermatoscopy images, which present more easily identifiable lesion boundaries than clinical photos taken with smartphones. This limitation constrains the practicality of these approaches to real-world applications. To overcome the challenges posed by noisy clinical photos acquired via non-standardized protocols and to improve diagnostic accessibility, we propose a novel Cross-Attentive Fusion framework for interpretable skin lesion diagnosis. Our method leverages SAM to generate visual concepts for skin diseases using prompts, integrating local visual concepts with global image features to enhance model performance. Extensive evaluation on two skin disease datasets demonstrates our proposed method's effectiveness on lesion diagnosis and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by WACV 2025</p></details> |

In contrast to traditional NAS methods, recently proposed one-shot NAS methods prove to be more efficient in performing NAS. One-shot NAS works by generating a singular weight-sharing supernetwork that acts as a search space (container) of subnetworks. Despite its achievements, designing the one-shot search space remains a major challenge. In this work we propose a search space design strategy for Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architectures. In particular, we convert the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a weight-sharing supernetwork called SuperSAM. Our approach involves automating the search space design via layer-wise structured pruning and parameter prioritization. While the structured pruning applies probabilistic removal of certain transformer layers, parameter prioritization performs weight reordering and slicing of MLP-blocks in the remaining layers. We train supernetworks on several datasets using the sandwich rule. For deployment, we enhance subnetwork discovery by utilizing a program autotuner to identify efficient subnetworks within the search space. The resulting subnetworks are 30-70% smaller in size compared to the original pre-trained SAM ViT-B, yet outperform the pretrained model. Our work introduces a new and effective method for ViT NAS search-space design.</p></details> |  |

Recent part segmentation methods require extensive training data and labor-intensive annotations. Segment-Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated good performance on a wide range of segmentation problems, but requires (manual) positional prompts to guide it where to segment. Furthermore, since it has been trained on full objects instead of object parts, it is prone to over-segmentation of parts. To address this, we propose a novel approach that guides SAM towards the relevant object parts. Our method learns positional prompts from coarse patch annotations that are easier and cheaper to acquire. We train classifiers on image patches to identify part classes and aggregate patches into regions of interest (ROIs) with positional prompts. SAM is conditioned on these ROIs and prompts. This approach, termed `Guided SAM', enhances efficiency and reduces manual effort, allowing effective part segmentation with minimal labeled data. We demonstrate the efficacy of Guided SAM on a dataset of car parts, improving the average IoU on state of the art models from 0.37 to 0.49 with annotations that are on average five times more efficient to acquire.</p></details> |  |

Although several high-quality datasets are broadly accessible, data scarcity remains for specialized tasks like marine oil spill segmentation. Such tasks still rely on manual annotation, which is both time-consuming and influenced by subjective human factors. The segment anything model 2 (SAM2) has strong potential as an automatic annotation framework but struggles to perform effectively on heterogeneous, low-contrast remote sensing imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel label enhancement and automatic annotation framework, termed SAM2-ELNet (Enhancement and Labeling Network). Specifically, we employ the frozen Hiera backbone from the pretrained SAM2 as the encoder, while fine-tuning the adapter and decoder for different remote sensing tasks. In addition, the proposed framework includes a label quality evaluator for filtering, ensuring the reliability of the generated labels. We design a series of experiments targeting resource-limited remote sensing tasks and evaluate our method on two datasets: the Deep-SAR Oil Spill (SOS) dataset with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, and the CHN6-CUG Road dataset with Very High Resolution (VHR) optical imagery. The proposed framework can enhance coarse annotations and generate reliable training data under resource-limited conditions. Fine-tuned on only 30% of the training data, it generates automatically labeled data. A model trained solely on these achieves slightly lower performance than using the full original annotations, while greatly reducing labeling costs and offering a practical solution for large-scale remote sensing interpretation.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce TASAM, a terrain and temporally-aware extension of SAM designed specifically for high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. TASAM integrates three lightweight yet effective modules: a terrain-aware adapter that injects elevation priors, a temporal prompt generator that captures land-cover changes over time, and a multi-scale fusion strategy that enhances fine-grained object delineation. Without retraining the SAM backbone, our approach achieves substantial performance gains across three remote sensing benchmarks-LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD-outperforming both zero-shot SAM and task-specific models with minimal computational overhead. Our results highlight the value of domain-adaptive augmentation for foundation models and offer a scalable path toward more robust geospatial segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Baltimore Atlas: FreqWeaver Adapter for Semi-supervised Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15565v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-high Spatial Resolution (UHSR) Land Cover Classification is increasingly important for urban analysis, enabling fine-scale planning, ecological monitoring, and infrastructure management. It identifies land cover types on sub-meter remote sensing imagery, capturing details such as building outlines, road networks, and distinct boundaries. However, most existing methods focus on 1 m imagery and rely heavily on large-scale annotations, while UHSR data remain scarce and difficult to annotate, limiting practical applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce Baltimore Atlas, a UHSR land cover classification framework that reduces reliance on large-scale training data and delivers high-accuracy results. Baltimore Atlas builds on three key ideas: (1) Baltimore Atlas Dataset, a 0.3 m resolution dataset based on aerial imagery of Baltimore City; (2) FreqWeaver Adapter, a parameter-efficient adapter that transfers SAM2 to this domain, leveraging foundation model knowledge to reduce training data needs while enabling fine-grained detail and structural modeling; (3) Uncertainty-Aware Teacher Student Framework, a semi-supervised framework that exploits unlabeled data to further reduce training dependence and improve generalization across diverse scenes. Using only 5.96% of total model parameters, our approach achieves a 1.78% IoU improvement over existing parameter-efficient tuning strategies and a 3.44% IoU gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution remote sensing segmentation methods on the Baltimore Atlas Dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViRefSAM: Visual Reference-Guided Segment Anything Model for Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02294v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically, ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features, enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$, LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[RS-MTDF: Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion for Remote Sensing Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08772v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for various applications, yet its performance is heavily reliant on large-scale, high-quality pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS methods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization. To alleviate this issue, we attempt to introduce the Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) pre-trained on vast and diverse datasets into the SSS task since VFMs possess robust generalization capabilities that can effectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for SSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge embedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing. Specifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (e.g., DINOv2 and CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student features with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative power, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder. Extensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in the majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of multi-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and semantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each proposed module.</p></details> |  |
| **[F2Net: A Frequency-Fused Network for Ultra-High Resolution Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07847v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery is critical for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning but faces computational and optimization challenges. Conventional methods either lose fine details through downsampling or fragment global context via patch processing. While multi-branch networks address this trade-off, they suffer from computational inefficiency and conflicting gradient dynamics during training. We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches capturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module integrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency Alignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and Cross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to stabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39, respectively. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Modal Urban Sensing: Evaluating Sound-Vision Alignment Across Street-Level and Aerial Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03388v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental soundscapes convey substantial ecological and social information regarding urban environments; however, their potential remains largely untapped in large-scale geographic analysis. In this study, we investigate the extent to which urban sounds correspond with visual scenes by comparing various visual representation strategies in capturing acoustic semantics. We employ a multimodal approach that integrates geo-referenced sound recordings with both street-level and remote sensing imagery across three major global cities: London, New York, and Tokyo. Utilizing the AST model for audio, along with CLIP and RemoteCLIP for imagery, as well as CLIPSeg and Seg-Earth OV for semantic segmentation, we extract embeddings and class-level features to evaluate cross-modal similarity. The results indicate that street view embeddings demonstrate stronger alignment with environmental sounds compared to segmentation outputs, whereas remote sensing segmentation is more effective in interpreting ecological categories through a Biophony--Geophony--Anthrophony (BGA) framework. These findings imply that embedding-based models offer superior semantic alignment, while segmentation-based methods provide interpretable links between visual structure and acoustic ecology. This work advances the burgeoning field of multimodal urban sensing by offering novel perspectives for incorporating sound into geospatial analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[AerOSeg: Harnessing SAM for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation in Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09203v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation beyond predefined categories is a key challenge in remote sensing, where novel and unseen classes often emerge during inference. Open-vocabulary image Segmentation addresses these generalization issues in traditional supervised segmentation models while reducing reliance on extensive per-pixel annotations, which are both expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. Most Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) methods are designed for natural images but struggle with remote sensing data due to scale variations, orientation changes, and complex scene compositions. This necessitates the development of OVS approaches specifically tailored for remote sensing. In this context, we propose AerOSeg, a novel OVS approach for remote sensing data. First, we compute robust image-text correlation features using multiple rotated versions of the input image and domain-specific prompts. These features are then refined through spatial and class refinement blocks. Inspired by the success of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in diverse domains, we leverage SAM features to guide the spatial refinement of correlation features. Additionally, we introduce a semantic back-projection module and loss to ensure the seamless propagation of SAM's semantic information throughout the segmentation pipeline. Finally, we enhance the refined correlation features using a multi-scale attention-aware decoder to produce the final segmentation map. We validate our SAM-guided Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Segmentation model on three benchmark remote sensing datasets: iSAID, DLRSD, and OpenEarthMap. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.54 h-mIoU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EarthVision workshop, CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Center-guided Classifier for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16963v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared with natural images, remote sensing images (RSIs) have the unique characteristic. i.e., larger intraclass variance, which makes semantic segmentation for remote sensing images more challenging. Moreover, existing semantic segmentation models for remote sensing images usually employ a vanilla softmax classifier, which has three drawbacks: (1) non-direct supervision for the pixel representations during training; (2) inadequate modeling ability of parametric softmax classifiers under large intraclass variance; and (3) opaque process of classification decision. In this paper, we propose a novel classifier (called CenterSeg) customized for RSI semantic segmentation, which solves the abovementioned problems with multiple prototypes, direct supervision under Grassmann manifold, and interpretability strategy. Specifically, for each class, our CenterSeg obtains local class centers by aggregating corresponding pixel features based on ground-truth masks, and generates multiple prototypes through hard attention assignment and momentum updating. In addition, we introduce the Grassmann manifold and constrain the joint embedding space of pixel features and prototypes based on two additional regularization terms. Especially, during the inference, CenterSeg can further provide interpretability to the model by restricting the prototype as a sample of the training set. Experimental results on three remote sensing segmentation datasets validate the effectiveness of the model. Besides the superior performance, CenterSeg has the advantages of simplicity, lightweight, compatibility, and interpretability.

This task presents two principal challenges: (1) severe inconsistencies in feature representation across different remote sensing domains, and (2) a domain gap that emerges due to the representation bias of source domain patterns when translating features to predictive logits. To tackle these issues, we propose a joint-optimized adversarial network incorporating the "Segment Anything Model (SAM) (SAM-JOANet)" for UDA-RSSeg. Our approach integrates SAM to leverage its robust generalized representation capabilities, thereby alleviating feature inconsistencies. We introduce a finetuning decoder designed to convert SAM-Encoder features into predictive logits. Additionally, a feature-level adversarial-based prompted segmentor is employed to generate class-agnostic maps, which guide the finetuning decoder's feature representations. The network is optimized end-to-end, combining the prompted segmentor and the finetuning decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including ISPRS (Potsdam/Vaihingen) and CITY-OSM (Paris/Chicago), demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The results, supported by visualization and analysis, confirm the method's interpretability and robustness.

| **[Graph Information Bottleneck for Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02545v2)** | 2024-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing segmentation has a wide range of applications in environmental protection, and urban change detection, etc. Despite the success of deep learning-based remote sensing segmentation methods (e.g., CNN and Transformer), they are not flexible enough to model irregular objects. In addition, existing graph contrastive learning methods usually adopt the way of maximizing mutual information to keep the node representations consistent between different graph views, which may cause the model to learn task-independent redundant information. To tackle the above problems, this paper treats images as graph structures and introduces a simple contrastive vision GNN (SC-ViG) architecture for remote sensing segmentation. Specifically, we construct a node-masked and edge-masked graph view to obtain an optimal graph structure representation, which can adaptively learn whether to mask nodes and edges. Furthermore, this paper innovatively introduces information bottleneck theory into graph contrastive learning to maximize task-related information while minimizing task-independent redundant information. Finally, we replace the convolutional module in UNet with the SC-ViG module to complete the segmentation and classification tasks of remote sensing images. Extensive experiments on publicly available real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art remote sensing image segmentation methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Hi-ResNet: Edge Detail Enhancement for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12691v3)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution remote sensing (HRS) semantic segmentation extracts key objects from high-resolution coverage areas. However, objects of the same category within HRS images generally show significant differences in scale and shape across diverse geographical environments, making it difficult to fit the data distribution. Additionally, a complex background environment causes similar appearances of objects of different categories, which precipitates a substantial number of objects into misclassification as background. These issues make existing learning algorithms sub-optimal. In this work, we solve the above-mentioned problems by proposing a High-resolution remote sensing network (Hi-ResNet) with efficient network structure designs, which consists of a funnel module, a multi-branch module with stacks of information aggregation (IA) blocks, and a feature refinement module, sequentially, and Class-agnostic Edge Aware (CEA) loss. Specifically, we propose a funnel module to downsample, which reduces the computational cost, and extract high-resolution semantic information from the initial input image. Secondly, we downsample the processed feature images into multi-resolution branches incrementally to capture image features at different scales and apply IA blocks, which capture key latent information by leveraging attention mechanisms, for effective feature aggregation, distinguishing image features of the same class with variant scales and shapes. Finally, our feature refinement module integrate the CEA loss function, which disambiguates inter-class objects with similar shapes and increases the data distribution distance for correct predictions. With effective pre-training strategies, we demonstrated the superiority of Hi-ResNet over state-of-the-art methods on three HRS segmentation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALPS: An Auto-Labeling and Pre-training Scheme for Remote Sensing Segmentation With Segment Anything Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10855v1)** | 2024-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the fast-growing field of Remote Sensing (RS) image analysis, the gap between massive unlabeled datasets and the ability to fully utilize these datasets for advanced RS analytics presents a significant challenge. To fill the gap, our work introduces an innovative auto-labeling framework named ALPS (Automatic Labeling for Pre-training in Segmentation), leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to predict precise pseudo-labels for RS images without necessitating prior annotations or additional prompts. The proposed pipeline significantly reduces the labor and resource demands traditionally associated with annotating RS datasets. By constructing two comprehensive pseudo-labeled RS datasets via ALPS for pre-training purposes, our approach enhances the performance of downstream tasks across various benchmarks, including iSAID and ISPRS Potsdam. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its ability to generalize well across multiple tasks even under the scarcity of extensively annotated datasets, offering a scalable solution to automatic segmentation and annotation challenges in the field. In addition, the proposed a pipeline is flexible and can be applied to medical image segmentation, remarkably boosting the performance. Note that ALPS utilizes pre-trained SAM to semi-automatically annotate RS images without additional manual annotations. Though every component in the pipeline has bee well explored, integrating clustering algorithms with SAM and novel pseudo-label alignment significantly enhances RS segmentation, as an off-the-shelf tool for pre-training data preparation.

Previous efforts are dedicated to mining segmentation-guiding visual cues from a constrained set of support samples. However, they still struggle to address the pronounced intra-class differences in RS images, as sparse visual cues make it challenging to establish robust class-specific representations. In this paper, we propose a holistic semantic embedding (HSE) approach that effectively harnesses general semantic knowledge, i.e., class description (CD) embeddings.Instead of the naive combination of CD embeddings and visual features for segmentation decoding, we investigate embedding the general semantic knowledge during the feature extraction stage.Specifically, in HSE, a spatial dense interaction module allows the interaction of visual support features with CD embeddings along the spatial dimension via self-attention.Furthermore, a global content modulation module efficiently augments the global information of the target category in both support and query features, thanks to the transformative fusion of visual features and CD embeddings.These two components holistically synergize general CD embeddings and visual cues, constructing a robust class-specific representation.Through extensive experiments on the standard FSS benchmark, the proposed HSE approach demonstrates superior performance compared to peer work, setting a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

This framework employs a two-stage network design: the first stage extracts features using spatial methods to obtain features with sufficient spatial details and semantic information; the second stage maps these features in both spatial and frequency domains. In the frequency domain mapping, we introduce the Wavelet Transform Feature Decomposer (WTFD) structure, which decomposes features into low-frequency and high-frequency components using the Haar wavelet transform and integrates them with spatial features. To bridge the semantic gap between frequency and spatial features, and facilitate significant feature selection to promote the combination of features from different representation domains, we design the Multiscale Dual-Representation Alignment Filter (MDAF). This structure utilizes multiscale convolutions and dual-cross attentions. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, SFFNet achieves superior performance in terms of mIoU, reaching 84.80% and 87.73% respectively.The code is located at https://github.com/yysdck/SFFNet.</p></details> |  |

Segmentation and extraction of specific targets are essential tasks when facing the vast and complex remote sensing images. Recently, the introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides a universal pre-training model for image segmentation tasks. While the direct application of SAM to remote sensing image segmentation tasks does not yield satisfactory results, we propose RSAM-Seg, which stands for Remote Sensing SAM with Semantic Segmentation, as a tailored modification of SAM for the remote sensing field and eliminates the need for manual intervention to provide prompts. Adapter-Scale, a set of supplementary scaling modules, are proposed in the multi-head attention blocks of the encoder part of SAM. Furthermore, Adapter-Feature are inserted between the Vision Transformer (ViT) blocks. These modules aim to incorporate high-frequency image information and image embedding features to generate image-informed prompts. Experiments are conducted on four distinct remote sensing scenarios, encompassing cloud detection, field monitoring, building detection and road mapping tasks . The experimental results not only showcase the improvement over the original SAM and U-Net across cloud, buildings, fields and roads scenarios, but also highlight the capacity of RSAM-Seg to discern absent areas within the ground truth of certain datasets, affirming its potential as an auxiliary annotation method. In addition, the performance in few-shot scenarios is commendable, underscores its potential in dealing with limited datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

There are two research gaps in the current research: 1) Most studies only focus on the relationship between design elements and pay little attention to the external information of the site; 2) GAN and other traditional generative algorithms generate results with low resolution and insufficient details. To address these two problems, we integrate GAN, Stable diffusion multimodal large-scale image pre-training model to construct a full-process park generative design method: 1) First, construct a high-precision remote sensing object extraction system for automated extraction of urban environmental information; 2) Secondly, use GAN to construct a park design generation system based on the external environment, which can quickly infer and generate design schemes from urban environmental information; 3) Finally, introduce Stable Diffusion to optimize the design plan, fill in details, and expand the resolution of the plan by 64 times. This method can achieve a fully unmanned design automation workflow. The research results show that: 1) The relationship between the inside and outside of the site will affect the algorithm generation results. 2) Compared with traditional GAN algorithms, Stable diffusion significantly improve the information richness of the generated results.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, this paper proposes an efficient Generative Adversarial Transfomer (GATrans) for achieving high-precision semantic segmentation while maintaining an extremely efficient size. The framework utilizes a Global Transformer Network (GTNet) as the generator, efficiently extracting multi-level features through residual connections. GTNet employs global transformer blocks with progressively linear computational complexity to reassign global features based on a learnable similarity function. To focus on object-level and pixel-level information, the GATrans optimizes the objective function by combining structural similarity losses. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on the Vaihingen dataset, achieving an average F1 score of 90.17% and an overall accuracy of 91.92%.</p></details> |  |

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn unique and adaptive features to achieve this aim. However, due to the large size and high spatial resolution of remote sensing images, these networks cannot analyze an entire scene efficiently. Recently, deep transformers have proven their capability to record global interactions between different objects in the image. In this paper, we propose a new segmentation model that combines convolutional neural networks with transformers, and show that this mixture of local and global feature extraction techniques provides significant advantages in remote sensing segmentation. In addition, the proposed model includes two fusion layers that are designed to represent multi-modal inputs and output of the network efficiently. The input fusion layer extracts feature maps summarizing the relationship between image content and elevation maps (DSM). The output fusion layer uses a novel multi-task segmentation strategy where class labels are identified using class-specific feature extraction layers and loss functions. Finally, a fast-marching method is used to convert all unidentified class labels to their closest known neighbors. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methodology improves segmentation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

We perform a rigorous evaluation of SimCLR, a self-supervised method, and FixMatch, a semi-supervised method, on three remote sensing tasks: riverbed segmentation, land cover mapping, and flood mapping. We quantify performance improvements on these remote sensing segmentation tasks when additional imagery outside of the original supervised dataset is made available for training. We also design experiments to test the effectiveness of these techniques when the test set is domain shifted to sample different geographic areas compared to the training and validation sets. We find that such techniques significantly improve generalization performance when labeled data is limited and there are geographic domain shifts between the training data and the validation/test data.</p></details> |  |

However, their ability to generalize in low-data regimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot adaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten remote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used few-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying backbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance can exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The variability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing methods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for few-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to systematically evaluate RSVLMs under few-shot conditions.

However, existing studies in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25 categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark, demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at https://github.com/earth-insights/DescribeEarth.</p></details> |  |

However, existing RS VQA datasets are constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain. RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1 then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises 13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs), demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Multimedia Conference (ACM Multimedia 2025)</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and (3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal large language models and remote sensing vision-language models.

| **[Enhancing Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models Through MLLM and LLM-Based High-Quality Image-Text Dataset Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16716v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) to remote sensing (RS) imagery has garnered significant attention due to their superior capability in various downstream tasks. A key challenge lies in the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs. However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data, while only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for generating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs generation methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from multiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset, including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an image-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP and RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only 4.2\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or even exceed manual annotations. Dataset, pre-trained models, and codes will be released at https://github.com/YiguoHe/HQRS-210K-and-HQRS-CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>SUBMI...</summary><p>SUBMIT TO IEEE TRANSACTIONS</p></details> |

In this work, we focus on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), a Vision-Language foundation model that achieves high accuracy across various image classification tasks and often rivals fully supervised baselines, despite not being explicitly trained for those tasks. Nevertheless, there are still domains where zero-shot CLIP performance is far from optimal, such as Remote Sensing (RS) and medical imagery. These domains do not only exhibit fundamentally different distributions compared to natural images, but also commonly rely on complementary modalities, beyond RGB, to derive meaningful insights. To this end, we propose a methodology to align distinct RS image modalities with the visual and textual modalities of CLIP. Our two-stage procedure addresses the aforementioned distribution shift, extends the zero-shot capabilities of CLIP and enriches CLIP's shared embedding space with domain-specific knowledge. Initially, we robustly fine-tune CLIP according to the PAINT (Ilharco et al., 2022) patching protocol, in order to deal with the distribution shift. Building upon this foundation, we facilitate the cross-modal alignment of a RS modality encoder by distilling knowledge from the CLIP visual and textual encoders. We empirically show that both patching and cross-modal alignment translate to significant performance gains, across several RS imagery classification and cross-modal retrieval benchmark datasets. Notably, these enhancements are achieved without the reliance on textual descriptions, without introducing any task-specific parameters, without training from scratch and without catastrophic forgetting.

These models combine various data modalities, such as optical, radar, and LiDAR imagery, with textual and geographic information, enabling more comprehensive analysis and understanding of remote sensing data. The integration of multiple modalities allows for improved performance in tasks like object detection, land cover classification, and change detection, which are often challenged by the complex and heterogeneous nature of remote sensing data. However, despite these advancements, several challenges remain. The diversity in data types, the need for large-scale annotated datasets, and the complexity of multimodal fusion techniques pose significant obstacles to the effective deployment of these models. Moreover, the computational demands of training and fine-tuning multimodal models require significant resources, further complicating their practical application in remote sensing image interpretation tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in vision and multimodal foundation models for remote sensing, focusing on their architecture, training methods, datasets and application scenarios. We discuss the key challenges these models face, such as data alignment, cross-modal transfer learning, and scalability, while also identifying emerging research directions aimed at overcoming these limitations. Our goal is to provide a clear understanding of the current landscape of remote sensing foundation models and inspire future research that can push the boundaries of what these models can achieve in real-world applications.

However, their conventional usage in zero-shot scene classification methods still involves dividing large images into patches and making independent predictions, i.e., inductive inference, thereby limiting their effectiveness by ignoring valuable contextual information. Our approach tackles this issue by utilizing initial predictions based on text prompting and patch affinity relationships from the image encoder to enhance zero-shot capabilities through transductive inference, all without the need for supervision and at a minor computational cost. Experiments on 10 remote sensing datasets with state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over inductive zero-shot classification.

While performing well in multi-modal reasoning and multi-turn conversations, the existing models lack pixel-level understanding and struggle with multi-image inputs. In this work, we propose RSUniVLM, a unified, end-to-end RS VLM designed for comprehensive vision understanding across multiple granularity, including image-level, region-level, and pixel-level tasks. RSUniVLM also performs effectively in multi-image analysis, with instances of change detection and change captioning. To enhance the model's ability to capture visual information at different levels without increasing model size, we design a novel architecture called Granularity-oriented Mixture of Experts to constraint the model to about 1 billion parameters. We also construct a large-scale RS instruction-following dataset based on a variety of existing datasets in both RS and general domain, encompassing various tasks such as object localization, visual question answering, and semantic segmentation. Substantial experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed RSUniVLM up to state-of-the-art across various RS tasks.

| **[Aquila: A Hierarchically Aligned Visual-Language Model for Enhanced Remote Sensing Image Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06074v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large vision language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in visual language capabilities through visual instruction tuning, showing great promise in the field of remote sensing image interpretation. However, existing remote sensing vision language models (RSVLMs) often fall short in capturing the complex characteristics of remote sensing scenes, as they typically rely on low resolution, single scale visual features and simplistic methods to map visual features to language features. In this paper, we present Aquila, an advanced visual language foundation model designed to enable richer visual feature representation and more precise visual-language feature alignment for remote sensing images. Our approach introduces a learnable Hierarchical Spatial Feature Integration (SFI) module that supports high resolution image inputs and aggregates multi scale visual features, allowing for the detailed representation of complex visual information. Additionally, the SFI module is repeatedly integrated into the layers of the large language model (LLM) to achieve deep visual language feature alignment, without compromising the model's performance in natural language processing tasks. These innovations, capturing detailed visual effects through higher resolution and multi scale input, and enhancing feature alignment significantly improve the model's ability to learn from image text data. We validate the effectiveness of Aquila through extensive quantitative experiments and qualitative analyses, demonstrating its superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[RSGPT: A Remote Sensing Vision Language Model and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15266v1)** | 2023-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large-scale large language models, with GPT-4 as a prominent example, has significantly propelled the rapid advancement of artificial general intelligence and sparked the revolution of Artificial Intelligence 2.0. In the realm of remote sensing (RS), there is a growing interest in developing large vision language models (VLMs) specifically tailored for data analysis in this domain. However, current research predominantly revolves around visual recognition tasks, lacking comprehensive, large-scale image-text datasets that are aligned and suitable for training large VLMs, which poses significant challenges to effectively training such models for RS applications. In computer vision, recent research has demonstrated that fine-tuning large vision language models on small-scale, high-quality datasets can yield impressive performance in visual and language understanding. These results are comparable to state-of-the-art VLMs trained from scratch on massive amounts of data, such as GPT-4. Inspired by this captivating idea, in this work, we build a high-quality Remote Sensing Image Captioning dataset (RSICap) that facilitates the development of large VLMs in the RS field. Unlike previous RS datasets that either employ model-generated captions or short descriptions, RSICap comprises 2,585 human-annotated captions with rich and high-quality information. This dataset offers detailed descriptions for each image, encompassing scene descriptions (e.g., residential area, airport, or farmland) as well as object information (e.g., color, shape, quantity, absolute position, etc). To facilitate the evaluation of VLMs in the field of RS, we also provide a benchmark evaluation dataset called RSIEval. This dataset consists of human-annotated captions and visual question-answer pairs, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of VLMs in the context of RS.</p></details> |  |

| **[ChartAB: A Benchmark for Chart Grounding & Dense Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26781v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases, weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened in current models.</p></details> |  |

Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points. Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through activation engineering.</p></details> |  |

However, these models remain constrained by the single-frame image paradigm and fail to fully leverage the temporal information offered by multi-frame histories, as directly feeding multiple frames into VLM backbones incurs substantial computational overhead and inference latency. We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends single-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm. CronusVLA follows a two-stage process: (1) Single-frame pretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive prediction of action tokens, establishing an effective embodied vision-language foundation; (2) Multi-frame post-training, which adapts the prediction of the vision-language backbone from discrete tokens to learnable features, and aggregates historical information via feature chunking. CronusVLA effectively addresses the existing challenges of multi-frame modeling while enhancing performance and observational robustness. To evaluate the robustness under temporal and spatial disturbances, we introduce SimplerEnv-OR, a novel benchmark featuring 24 types of observational disturbances and 120 severity levels. Experiments across three embodiments in simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that CronusVLA achieves leading performance and superior robustness, with a 70.9% success rate on SimplerEnv, a 26.8% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO, and the highest robustness score on SimplerEnv-OR. These results highlight the potential of efficient multi-frame adaptation in VLA models for more powerful and robust real-world deployment.</p></details> | 39 pages, 24 figures |

However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities.</p></details> |  |

We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly. We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples, forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines.

| **[Counteracting Matthew Effect in Self-Improvement of LVLMs through Head-Tail Re-balancing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26474v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations, this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Representation-Level Counterfactual Calibration for Debiased Zero-Shot Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26466v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores. Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images. However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance, which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability, trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably, our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures |

In this work, we observe that different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking workflows.

To address the lack of resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor, target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other), and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model (VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms, producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks: dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in multimodal humor understanding and content moderation.

While Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate accuracy alone does not reveal.</p></details> | Work in progress |

A Psychophysics-Grounded Evaluation for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26241v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially, under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans. Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g., free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition) that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need for actual radiology reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Computer Vision for Automated Medical Diagnosis (CVAMD) Workshop at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

We hypothesize this gap stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address. By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding, knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux, IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Agentic Video Analytics Systems with Video Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00254v4)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly important across diverse domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Vision Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively-significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%. The source code of AVA is available at https://github.com/I-ESC/Project-Ava. The AVA-100 benchmark can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/datasets/iesc/Ava-100.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NDSI 2026, 19pages, 12 figures, complementary evaluations and appendix</p></details> |

However, current LVLMs exhibit a notable imbalance between these skills, falling short on visual reasoning that is difficult to perform in text. We conduct a case study using a synthetic dataset solvable only through visual reasoning and show that model performance degrades significantly with increasing visual complexity, while human performance remains robust. We then introduce ChartMuseum, a new Chart Question Answering (QA) benchmark containing 1,162 expert-annotated questions spanning multiple reasoning types, curated from real-world charts across 184 sources, specifically built to evaluate complex visual and textual reasoning. Unlike prior chart understanding benchmarks -- where frontier models perform similarly and near saturation -- our benchmark exposes a substantial gap between model and human performance, while effectively differentiating model capabilities: although humans achieve 93% accuracy, the best-performing model Gemini-2.5-Pro attains only 63.0%, and the leading open-source LVLM Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct achieves only 38.5%. Moreover, on questions requiring primarily visual reasoning, all models experience a 35%-55% performance drop from text-reasoning-heavy question performance. Lastly, our qualitative error analysis reveals specific categories of visual reasoning that are challenging for current LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Datasets & Benchmarks</p></details> |

We present a framework that brings chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer human-AI collaboration. Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality is as critical as prediction quality.</p></details> | NV-Reason-CXR-3B |

In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies, failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies. In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description, explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations, their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenIR: Generative Visual Feedback for Mental Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06220v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind. That is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation for future research in this direction</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, these encoding methods lack the ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of recognizing and aligning with human moral values.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version: corresponds to the ACM MM '25 published paper and includes full appendix material</p></details> |

Despite significant progress in AI and computer vision (CV), there remains a lack of benchmarks for assessing models' abilities to infer latent causality from complex visual data. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{\textbf{Causal3D}}, a novel and comprehensive benchmark that integrates structured data (tables) with corresponding visual representations (images) to evaluate causal reasoning. Designed within a systematic framework, Causal3D comprises 19 3D-scene datasets capturing diverse causal relations, views, and backgrounds, enabling evaluations across scenes of varying complexity. We assess multiple state-of-the-art methods, including classical causal discovery, causal representation learning, and large/vision-language models (LLMs/VLMs). Our experiments show that as causal structures grow more complex without prior knowledge, performance declines significantly, highlighting the challenges even advanced methods face in complex causal scenarios. Causal3D serves as a vital resource for advancing causal reasoning in CV and fostering trustworthy AI in critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Datasets link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/LLDDSS/Causal3D_Dataset</p></details> |
| **[Latent Chain-of-Thought for Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23925v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking. Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Existing approaches typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and efficient long-document understanding.</p></details> |  |

Yet when these VLMs are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning, showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together, our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to recover inherited VL capabilities.

However, the feasibility of these task-level plans relies on the downward refinability of the abstraction into continuous motion. When a domain's refinability is poor, task-level plans that appear valid may ultimately fail during motion planning, requiring replanning and resulting in slower overall performance. Prior works mitigate this by encoding refinement issues as constraints to prune infeasible task plans. However, these approaches only add constraints upon refinement failure, expending significant search effort on infeasible branches. We propose VIZ-COAST, a method of leveraging the common-sense spatial reasoning of large pretrained Vision-Language Models to identify issues with downward refinement a priori, bypassing the need to fix these failures during planning. Experiments on two challenging TAMP domains show that our approach is able to extract plausible constraints from images and domain descriptions, drastically reducing planning times and, in some cases, eliminating downward refinement failures altogether, generalizing to a diverse range of instances from the broader domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 1 table.

Recently, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering, annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted, slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RANLP 2025</p></details> |

Understanding sarcastic image-text posts often requires external contextual knowledge, such as cultural references or commonsense reasoning. However, existing models struggle to capture the deeper rationale behind sarcasm, relying mainly on shallow cues like image captions or object-attribute pairs from images. To address this, we propose \textbf{MiDRE} (\textbf{Mi}xture of \textbf{D}ual \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{E}xperts), which integrates an internal reasoning expert for detecting incongruities within the image-text pair and an external reasoning expert that utilizes structured rationales generated via Chain-of-Thought prompting to a Large Vision-Language Model. An adaptive gating mechanism dynamically weighs the two experts, selecting the most relevant reasoning path. Unlike prior methods that treat external knowledge as static input, MiDRE selectively adapts to when such knowledge is beneficial, mitigating the risks of hallucinated or irrelevant signals from large models. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MiDRE achieves superior performance over baselines. Various qualitative analyses highlight the crucial role of external rationales, revealing that even when they are occasionally noisy, they provide valuable cues that guide the model toward a better understanding of sarcasm.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances, language-driven navigation is still difficult, particularly for UAVs in small-scale 3D environments. Existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) approaches are mostly designed for ground robots and struggle to generalize to aerial tasks that require full 3D spatial reasoning. The emergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT and Claude, enables zero-shot semantic reasoning from visual and textual inputs. However, these models lack spatial grounding and are not directly applicable to navigation. To address these limitations, SoraNav is introduced, an adaptive UAV navigation framework that integrates zero-shot VLM reasoning with geometry-aware decision-making. Geometric priors are incorporated into image annotations to constrain the VLM action space and improve decision quality. A hybrid switching strategy leverages navigation history to alternate between VLM reasoning and geometry-based exploration, mitigating dead-ends and redundant revisits. A PX4-based hardware-software platform, comprising both a digital twin and a physical micro-UAV, enables reproducible evaluation. Experimental results show that in 2.5D scenarios, our method improves Success Rate (SR) by 25.7% and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) by 17%. In 3D scenarios, it improves SR by 29.5% and SPL by 18.5% relative to the baseline.</p></details> |  |

We extend this paradigm to safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder, Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF), and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable, and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety governance.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present SCD-Bench (Safety Cognition Driving Benchmark) a novel framework specifically designed to assess the safety cognition capabilities of VLMs within interactive driving scenarios. To address the scalability challenge of data annotation, we introduce ADA (Autonomous Driving Annotation), a semi-automated labeling system, further refined through expert review by professionals with domain-specific knowledge in autonomous driving. To facilitate scalable and consistent evaluation, we also propose an automated assessment pipeline leveraging large language models, which demonstrates over 98% agreement with human expert judgments. In addressing the broader challenge of aligning VLMs with safety cognition in driving environments, we construct SCD-Training, the first large-scale dataset tailored for this task, comprising 324.35K high-quality samples. Through extensive experiments, we show that models trained on SCD-Training exhibit marked improvements not only on SCD-Bench, but also on general and domain-specific benchmarks, offering a new perspective on enhancing safety-aware interactions in vision-language systems for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Most representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However, SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting, weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation; (2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow, transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%. Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and raising the performance ceiling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/Kwen-Chen/SPECS-VL</p></details> |

However, most existing work focuses on reactive System 1 policies, underutilizing VLMs' strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. These System 2 capabilities-characterized by deliberative, goal-directed thinking-remain under explored due to the limited temporal scale and structural complexity of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce RoboCerebra, a benchmark for evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation. RoboCerebra includes: (1) a large-scale simulation dataset with extended task horizons and diverse subtask sequences in household environments; (2) a hierarchical framework combining a high-level VLM planner with a low-level vision-language-action (VLA) controller; and (3) an evaluation protocol targeting planning, reflection, and memory through structured System 1-System 2 interaction. The dataset is constructed via a top-down pipeline, where GPT generates task instructions and decomposes them into subtask sequences. Human operators execute the subtasks in simulation, yielding high-quality trajectories with dynamic object variations. Compared to prior benchmarks, RoboCerebra features significantly longer action sequences and denser annotations. We further benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules and analyze their performance across key cognitive dimensions, advancing the development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 18 figures, Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches often overlook these spatial relationships, limiting their flexibility and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose OrderMind, a unified spatial-aware manipulation ordering framework that directly learns object manipulation priorities based on spatial context. Our architecture integrates a spatial context encoder with a temporal priority structuring module. We construct a spatial graph using k-Nearest Neighbors to aggregate geometric information from the local layout and encode both object-object and object-manipulator interactions to support accurate manipulation ordering in real-time. To generate physically and semantically plausible supervision signals, we introduce a spatial prior labeling method that guides a vision-language model to produce reasonable manipulation orders for distillation.

| **[MemEIC: A Step Toward Continual and Compositional Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25798v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates, potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, 38 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

However, their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, such as mobile robots or embedded systems (e.g., Jetson Orin Nano), remains challenging due to high computational demands, especially in real-world scenarios where power, latency, and computational resources are critical. To close this gap, we introduce Nano-scale Vision-Language Action (NanoVLA), a family of lightweight VLA architectures that achieve high performance with minimal resources. Our core innovations include: (1) vision-language decoupling that moves conventional early vision and language inputs fusion in VLM to late stage, achieving better performance while enabling caching and reduce inference overhead and latency; (2) long-short action chunking to ensure smooth, coherent multi-step planning without sacrificing real-time responsiveness; (3) dynamic routing that adaptively assigns lightweight or heavy backbones based on task complexity, further optimizing inference efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmarks, as well as real-world deployments, demonstrate that NanoVLA achieves up to 52x faster inference on edge devices compared to previous state-of-the-art VLA models, with 98% less parameters while maintaining or surpassing their task accuracy and generalization. Ablation studies confirm that our decoupling strategy preserves cross-task transferability, and the routing module enhances cost-performance trade-offs, enabling practical, high-precision robotic manipulation on resource-constrained hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Diversity and Region-aware Prompt Learning for Zero-shot HOI Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25094v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2) inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second, we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions. These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement.

Selective Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16854v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be an effective post-training strategy for enhancing reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a recent prominent method that encourages models to generate complete reasoning traces before answering, leading to increased token usage and computational cost. Inspired by the human-like thinking process-where people skip reasoning for easy questions but think carefully when needed-we explore how to enable VLMs to first decide when reasoning is necessary. To realize this, we propose TON, a two-stage training strategy: (i) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage with a simple yet effective 'thought dropout' operation, where reasoning traces are randomly replaced with empty thoughts. This introduces a think-or-not format that serves as a cold start for selective reasoning; (ii) a GRPO stage that enables the model to freely explore when to think or not, while maximizing task-aware outcome rewards. Experimental results show that TON can reduce the completion length by up to 90% compared to vanilla GRPO, without sacrificing performance or even improving it. Further evaluations across LLM (GSM8K), VLM (CLEVR, Super-CLEVR, GeoQA), and Agentic (AITZ) tasks-covering a range of reasoning difficulties under both 3B and 7B models-consistently reveal that the model progressively learns to bypass unnecessary reasoning steps as training advances. These findings shed light on the path toward human-like reasoning patterns in RL approaches.

However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.</p></details> |  |

Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and 91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model. Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Physics Context Builders: A Modular Framework for Physical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08619v3)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical reasoning remains a significant challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This limitation arises from an inability to translate learned knowledge into predictions about physical behavior. Although continual fine-tuning can mitigate this issue, it is expensive for large models and impractical to perform repeatedly for every task. This necessitates the creation of modular and scalable ways to teach VLMs about physical reasoning. To that end, we introduce Physics Context Builders (PCBs), a modular framework where specialized smaller VLMs are fine-tuned to generate detailed physical scene descriptions. These can be used as physical contexts to enhance the reasoning capabilities of larger VLMs. PCBs enable the separation of visual perception from reasoning, allowing us to analyze their relative contributions to physical understanding. We perform experiments on CLEVRER and on Falling Tower, a stability detection dataset with both simulated and real-world scenes, to demonstrate that PCBs provide substantial performance improvements, increasing average accuracy by up to 13.8% on complex physical reasoning tasks. Notably, PCBs also show strong Sim2Real transfer, successfully generalizing from simulated training data to real-world scenes.</p></details> |  |

These approaches are impractical for large-scale deployment due to cost and efficiency constraints. To address these shortcomings, we propose SCOUT (Scenario Coverage Oversight and Understanding Tool), a lightweight surrogate model designed to predict scenario coverage labels directly from an agent's latent sensor representations. SCOUT is trained through a distillation process, learning to approximate LVLM-generated coverage labels while eliminating the need for continuous LVLM inference or human annotation. By leveraging precomputed perception features, SCOUT avoids redundant computations and enables fast, scalable scenario coverage estimation. We evaluate our method across a large dataset of real-life autonomous navigation scenarios, demonstrating that it maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost. Our results show that SCOUT provides an effective and practical alternative for large-scale coverage analysis. While its performance depends on the quality of LVLM-generated training labels, SCOUT represents a major step toward efficient scenario coverage oversight in autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

To understand how VLMs process culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector - Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the internal organization of multimodal representations.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we provide a comprehensive empirical study analyzing the impact of several multilingual design choices, such as training data composition, encoder selection, and text backbones. The result is TowerVision, a family of open multilingual VLMs for both image-text and video-text tasks, built upon the multilingual text-only model Tower+. TowerVision achieves competitive performance on multiple multimodal multilingual benchmarks and shows particular strength in culturally grounded tasks and multimodal translation. By incorporating visual and cultural context during fine-tuning, our models surpass existing approaches trained on substantially larger datasets, as demonstrated on ALM-Bench and Multi30K (image tasks) and ViMUL-Bench (video tasks). Alongside the models, we release VisionBlocks, a high-quality, curated vision-language dataset. Our findings highlight that multilingual vision-language training data substantially improves cross-lingual generalization -- both from high-resource to underrepresented languages and vice versa -- and that instruction-tuned LLMs are not always the optimal initialization point. To support further research, we publicly release all models, data, and training recipes.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, submitted to arXiv October 2025.

Although satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive, contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset. Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness. Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models, attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 40 figures, 3 algorithms</p></details> |

Research evolved from handcrafted feature extraction to large-scale automated feature learning. With foundation models (FMs), crop disease datasets are now processed in fundamentally new ways. Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning (AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in 2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM.

Existing methods based on vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from limited resolution, domain mismatch, and insufficient sequential decisionmaking capability. To address these issues, we propose Mano, a robust GUI agent built upon a multi-modal foundation model pre-trained on extensive web and computer system data. Our approach integrates a novel simulated environment for high-fidelity data generation, a three-stage training pipeline (supervised fine-tuning, offline reinforcement learning, and online reinforcement learning), and a verification module for error recovery. Mano demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple GUI benchmarks, including Mind2Web and OSWorld, achieving significant improvements in success rate and operational accuracy. Our work provides new insights into the effective integration of reinforcement learning with VLMs for practical GUI agent deployment, highlighting the importance of domain-specific data, iterative training, and holistic reward design.</p></details> |  |

While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.</p></details> | work in progress |

However, existing multimodal safety evaluations primarily focus on model vulnerabilities exposed by static image inputs, ignoring the temporal dynamics of video that may induce distinct safety risks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-SafetyBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LVLMs under video-text attacks. It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48 fine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a harmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears harmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video. To generate semantically accurate videos for safety evaluation, we design a controllable pipeline that decomposes video semantics into subject images (what is shown) and motion text (how it moves), which jointly guide the synthesis of query-relevant videos. To effectively evaluate uncertain or borderline harmful outputs, we propose RJScore, a novel LLM-based metric that incorporates the confidence of judge models and human-aligned decision threshold calibration. Extensive experiments show that benign-query video composition achieves average attack success rates of 67.2%, revealing consistent vulnerabilities to video-induced attacks. We believe Video-SafetyBench will catalyze future research into video-based safety evaluation and defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Dataset and Benchmark Track, Project page: https://liuxuannan.github.io/Video-SafetyBench.github.io/</p></details> |

However, these models often struggle with compositional reasoning - the ability to understand the relationships between concepts. A recent benchmark, SugarCrepe++, reveals that previous works on improving compositionality have mainly improved lexical sensitivity but neglected semantic understanding. In addition, downstream retrieval performance often deteriorates, although one would expect that improving compositionality should enhance retrieval. In this work, we introduce CLIC (Compositionally-aware Learning in CLIP), a fine-tuning method based on a novel training technique combining multiple images and their associated captions. CLIC improves compositionality across architectures as well as differently pre-trained CLIP models, both in terms of lexical and semantic understanding, and achieves consistent gains in retrieval performance. This even applies to the recent CLIPS, which achieves SOTA retrieval performance. Nevertheless, the short fine-tuning with CLIC leads to an improvement in retrieval and to the best compositional CLIP model on SugarCrepe++.

Investigating multimodal in-context learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24331v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration. These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal in-context examples.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization, multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets, including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios. Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end, VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student, on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a text-only teacher.</p></details> | <details><summary>www.w...</summary><p>www.walidbousselham.com/VOLD/</p></details> |

Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception, Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment in real-world LEO satellite systems remains largely unexplored, hindered by limited onboard computing resources and brief satellite-ground contacts. We propose Grace, a satellite-ground collaborative system designed for near-realtime LVLM inference in RS tasks. Accordingly, we deploy compact LVLM on satellites for realtime inference, but larger ones on ground stations (GSs) to guarantee end-to-end performance. Grace is comprised of two main phases that are asynchronous satellite-GS Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a task dispatch algorithm. Firstly, we still the knowledge archive of GS RAG to satellite archive with tailored adaptive update algorithm during limited satellite-ground data exchange period. Secondly, propose a confidence-based test algorithm that either processes the task onboard the satellite or offloads it to the GS. Extensive experiments based on real-world satellite orbital data show that Grace reduces the average latency by 76-95% compared to state-of-the-art methods, without compromising inference accuracy.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

| **[Enhancing Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving through Task-Specific Prompting and Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24152v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption detection tasks. We propose a systematic framework built on four core components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing, Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature, top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on safety-critical autonomous driving tasks.

In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases. Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model performance.</p></details> | Under review |

To address this challenge, we present a training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with prompts compared to recent text-to-image models.

They need to understand its reasoning, almost as if they were consulting a colleague. We created HistoLens1 to be that transparent, collaborative partner. It allows a pathologist to simply ask a question in plain English about a tissue slide--just as they would ask a trainee. Our system intelligently translates this question into a precise query for its AI engine, which then provides a clear, structured report. But it doesn't stop there. If a doctor ever asks, "Why?", HistoLens can instantly provide a 'visual proof' for any finding--a heatmap that points to the exact cells and regions the AI used for its analysis. We've also ensured the AI focuses only on the patient's tissue, just like a trained pathologist would, by teaching it to ignore distracting background noise. The result is a workflow where the pathologist remains the expert in charge, using a trustworthy AI assistant to verify their insights and make faster, more confident diagnoses.</p></details> |  |

HAI aims to better serve human welfare and needs, thereby placing higher demands on the intelligence level of robots, particularly in aspects such as natural language interaction, complex task planning, and execution. Intelligent agents powered by LLMs have opened up new pathways for realizing HAI. However, existing LLM-based embodied agents often lack the ability to plan and execute complex natural language control tasks online. This paper explores the implementation of intelligent robotic manipulating agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the physical world. We propose a novel embodied agent framework for robots, which comprises a human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent module and an action execution module. The vision-language agent itself includes a vision-based task planner, a natural language instruction converter, and a task performance feedback evaluator. Experimental results demonstrate that our agent achieves a 28\% higher average task success rate in both simulated and real environments compared to approaches relying solely on LLM+CLIP, significantly improving the execution success rate of high-level natural language instruction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging the gap to real-world language-grounded visual concept learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21412v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods.

| **[CalFuse: Multi-Modal Continual Learning via Feature Calibration and Parameter Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18672v8)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of multi-modal data in large-scale visual recognition systems, enabling models to continuously acquire knowledge from evolving data streams while preserving prior information has become increasingly critical. Class-Continual Learning (CCL) addresses this challenge by incrementally incorporating new class knowledge without revisiting historical data, making it essential for real-world big data applications. While traditional CCL methods rely solely on visual features, recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate significant potential for CCL by leveraging pre-trained multi-modal knowledge. However, existing approaches face challenges in mitigating catastrophic forgetting while maintaining the cross-modal generalization capabilities of VLMs. To address these limitations, we propose CalFuse, a framework that synergizes feature Calibration with parameter Fusion to enable effective multi-modal knowledge integration in continual learning scenarios. CalFuse introduces a dynamic feature calibration mechanism that adaptively balances original CLIP visual representations with task-specific features, preserving the model's intrinsic cross-modal generalization while adapting to new classes. Concurrently, a QR decomposition-based parameter fusion strategy progressively integrates newly acquired knowledge with historical task parameters, maintaining equilibrium between learning new class representations and retaining prior knowledge across sequential tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in large-scale multi-modal continual learning settings, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both average accuracy and final task retention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing CLIP Robustness via Cross-Modality Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24038v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features, which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other. This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations, leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14 zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA, especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |

Effective perception in navigation in unknown environment is critical for autonomous robots. While egocentric observations from RGB-D sensors provide abundant local information, real-time top-down maps offer valuable global context for ObjNav. Nevertheless, the majority of existing studies focus on a single source, seldom integrating these two complementary perceptual modalities, despite the fact that humans naturally attend to both. With the rapid advancement of Vision-Language Models(VLMs), we propose Hybrid Perception Navigation (HyPerNav), leveraging VLMs' strong reasoning and vision-language understanding capabilities to jointly perceive both local and global information to enhance the effectiveness and intelligence of navigation in unknown environments. In both massive simulation evaluation and real-world validation, our methods achieved state-of-the-art performance against popular baselines. Benefiting from hybrid perception approach, our method captures richer cues and finds the objects more effectively, by simultaneously leveraging information understanding from egocentric observations and the top-down map. Our ablation study further proved that either of the hybrid perception contributes to the navigation performance.</p></details> | under review |

Recently, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities to reason with both language and visual data. Although many works have focused on leveraging VLMs for navigation in open scenes, they often require high computational cost, rely on object-centric approaches, or depend on environmental priors in detailed human instructions. We introduce Navigation with VLM (NavVLM), a training-free framework that harnesses open-source VLMs to enable robots to navigate effectively, even for human-friendly language goal such as abstract places, actions, or specific objects in open scenes. NavVLM leverages the VLM as its cognitive core to perceive environmental information and constantly provides exploration guidance achieving intelligent navigation with only a neat target rather than a detailed instruction with environment prior. We evaluated and validated NavVLM in both simulation and real-world experiments. In simulation, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) on object-specifc tasks in richly detailed environments from Matterport 3D (MP3D), Habitat Matterport 3D (HM3D) and Gibson. With navigation episode reported, NavVLM demonstrates the capabilities to navigate towards any open-set languages. In real-world validation, we validated our framework's effectiveness in real-world robot at indoor scene.</p></details> | under review |

While such models have gained significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders, and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data, and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training. Mars-Bench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and comparing machine learning models for Mars science.

GRS creates digital twin simulations from single RGB-D observations with solvable tasks for virtual agent training.

We ensure simulation-task alignment through generated test suites and introduce a router that iteratively refines both simulation and test code. Experiments demonstrate our system's effectiveness in object correspondence and task environment generation through our novel router mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial. This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource, is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13 vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B. Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors while minimally affecting congruent trials.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Interpreting Cognition in Deep Learning Models at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing end-to-end methods still face significant challenges, such as suboptimal decision-making in complex scenarios. In this paper,we propose SimpleVSF (Simple VLM-Scoring Fusion), a novel framework that enhances end-to-end planning by leveraging the cognitive capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and advanced trajectory fusion techniques. We utilize the conventional scorers and the novel VLM-enhanced scorers. And we leverage a robust weight fusioner for quantitative aggregation and a powerful VLM-based fusioner for qualitative, context-aware decision-making. As the leading approach in the ICCV 2025 NAVSIM v2 End-to-End Driving Challenge, our SimpleVSF framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior balance between safety, comfort, and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRAID: Enhancing Spatial Reasoning of VLMs Through High-Fidelity Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22118v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning$\unicode{x2014}$a prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6% human validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from 2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16% human-validated accuracy$\unicode{x2014}$compared to 57.6% on a dataset generated by recent work. Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data, models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6 question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5% on BDD and 37.9% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all questions types, achieve improvements on several existing benchmarks such as BLINK.

We present an explainable image authenticity detection system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier ("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify, localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5% accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-SFLLM: Jamming Resilient Framework for Split Federated Learning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11654v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Split federated learning (SFL) is a compute-efficient paradigm in distributed machine learning (ML), where components of large ML models are outsourced to remote servers. A significant challenge in SFL, particularly when deployed over wireless channels, is the susceptibility of transmitted model parameters to adversarial jamming that could jeopardize the learning process. This is particularly pronounced for embedding parameters in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), which are learned feature vectors essential for domain understanding. In this paper, rigorous insights are provided into the influence of jamming embeddings in SFL by deriving an expression for the ML training loss divergence and showing that it is upper-bounded by the mean squared error (MSE). Based on this analysis, a physical layer framework is developed for resilient SFL with LLMs (R-SFLLM) over wireless networks. R-SFLLM leverages wireless sensing data to gather information on the jamming directions-of-arrival (DoAs) for the purpose of devising a novel, sensing-assisted anti-jamming strategy while jointly optimizing beamforming, user scheduling, and resource allocation. Extensive experiments using both LLMs and VLMs demonstrate R-SFLLM's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across various natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks, datasets, and modalities. The proposed methodology further introduces an adversarial training component, where controlled noise exposure significantly enhances the model's resilience to perturbed parameters during training. The results show that more noise-sensitive models, such as RoBERTa, benefit from this feature, especially when resource allocation is unfair. It is also shown that worst-case jamming in particular translates into worst-case model outcomes, thereby necessitating the need for jamming-resilient SFL protocols.</p></details> |  |
| **[RobotArena $\infty$: Scalable Robot Benchmarking via Real-to-Sim Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23571v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of robot generalists - instructable agents capable of performing diverse tasks across diverse environments - demands rigorous and scalable evaluation. Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally constrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models trained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments. As policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify, since defining "success" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of execution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework that overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale simulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging advances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and differentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts. Within these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from crowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup, resetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To measure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along multiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy generalization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot manipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's robotics landscape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://robotarenainf.github.io</p></details> |

Optimizing the initial noisy latent offers a more efficient alternative to modifying model architectures or prompt engineering for improving semantic alignment. A latest approach, InitNo, refines the initial noisy latent by leveraging attention maps; however, these maps capture only limited information, and the effectiveness of InitNo is highly dependent on the initial starting point, as it tends to converge on a local optimum near this point. To this end, this paper proposes leveraging the language comprehension capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to guide the optimization of the initial noisy latent, and introduces the Noise Diffusion process, which updates the noisy latent to generate semantically faithful images while preserving distribution consistency. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the condition under which the update improves semantic faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our framework, consistently enhancing semantic alignment across various diffusion models.

| **[On the Faithfulness of Visual Thinking: Measurement and Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23482v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention, indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks.

| **[Med-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Medical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13939v5)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored. Medical vision-language tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To address these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and reliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning beyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in average accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task generalization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1 outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a crucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1. Our results show that omitting intermediate rationales (No-Thinking-Med-R1) not only improves in-domain and cross-domain generalization with less training, but also challenges the assumption that more reasoning always helps. These findings suggest that in medical VQA, it is not reasoning itself, but its quality and domain alignment, that determine effectiveness. Together, these results highlight that RL improves medical reasoning and generalization, enabling efficient and reliable VLMs for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[World-Env: Leveraging World Model as a Virtual Environment for VLA Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24948v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and (2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task. Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in resource-constrained settings.

| **[GRE Suite: Geo-localization Inference via Fine-Tuned Vision-Language Models and Enhanced Reasoning Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18700v4)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark (GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained (e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex geographic inference. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/Thorin215/GRE.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Video Is Not Worth a Thousand Words](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23253v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering (VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors.

Existing hallucination detection methods frequently lack the necessary sentence-level granularity or robust generalization across different LVLM generators. We introduce a novel approach: a sentence-level Process Reward Model (PRM) adapted for this vision-language task. Our PRM predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence, conditioned on clinical context and preceding text. When fine-tuned on MIMIC-CXR with weakly-supervised labels, a lightweight 0.5B-parameter PRM outperforms existing verification techniques, demonstrating, for instance, relative improvements of 7.5% in Matthews Correlation Coefficient and 1.8% in AUROC over strong white-box baselines on outputs from one LVLM. Unlike methods reliant on internal model states, our PRM demonstrates strong generalization to an unseen LVLM. We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively filter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when discarding the worst 10% of reports). Moreover, when guiding a novel weighted best-of-N selection process on the MIMIC-CXR test set, our PRM show relative improvements in clinical metrics of 7.4% for F1-CheXbert and 0.6% for BERTScore. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, context-aware PRM provides a model-agnostic safety layer for clinical LVLMs without access to internal activations</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models (<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research on multilingual multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 tables and figures</p></details> |

DECO was the first in the wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders, class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii) halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge. Our code is available at https://github.com/DavidePasero/deco/tree/main.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of Vision-LLMs in Surveillance Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23190v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse 2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description, and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating VLMs is publicly available at: https://github.com/pascalbenschopTU/VLLM_AnomalyRecognition</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as poster in the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Space in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI</p></details> |
| **[Finding 3D Scene Analogies with Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23184v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies. In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from 3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in trajectory and waypoint transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to FM4RoboPlan workshop at RSS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Attention! Your Vision Language Model Could Be Maliciously Manipulated](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19911v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in understanding complex real-world scenarios and supporting data-driven decision-making processes. However, VLMs exhibit significant vulnerability against adversarial examples, either text or image, which can lead to various adversarial outcomes, e.g., jailbreaking, hijacking, and hallucination, etc. In this work, we empirically and theoretically demonstrate that VLMs are particularly susceptible to image-based adversarial examples, where imperceptible perturbations can precisely manipulate each output token. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Vision-language model Manipulation Attack (VMA), which integrates first-order and second-order momentum optimization techniques with a differentiable transformation mechanism to effectively optimize the adversarial perturbation. Notably, VMA can be a double-edged sword: it can be leveraged to implement various attacks, such as jailbreaking, hijacking, privacy breaches, Denial-of-Service, and the generation of sponge examples, etc, while simultaneously enabling the injection of watermarks for copyright protection. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy and generalizability of VMA across diverse scenarios and datasets.

A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21173v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under peer review</p></details> |

We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal understanding.

Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures during execution. Enabling robots to reason and recover from unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable creation of failure action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arms detect and recover from potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA models (pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, object and robotic embodiments. We plan to release the FailSafe code to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://jimntu.github.io/FailSafe</p></details> |

Existing methods typically rely on vision-language models like CLIP, but often exhibit limited sensitivity to text prompts. We present T2ICount, a diffusion-based framework that leverages rich prior knowledge and fine-grained visual understanding from pretrained diffusion models. While one-step denoising ensures efficiency, it leads to weakened text sensitivity. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic Correction Module that progressively refines text-image feature alignment, and a Representational Regional Coherence Loss that provides reliable supervision signals by leveraging the cross-attention maps extracted from the denosing U-Net. Furthermore, we observe that current benchmarks mainly focus on majority objects in images, potentially masking models' text sensitivity. To address this, we contribute a challenging re-annotated subset of FSC147 for better evaluation of text-guided counting ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across different benchmarks.

| **[HoliSafe: Holistic Safety Benchmarking and Modeling for Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04704v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, \textbf{HoliSafe}, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation (HoliSafe-Bench). We further propose a novel modular framework for enhancing VLM safety with a visual guard module (VGM) designed to assess the harmfulness of input images for VLMs. This module endows VLMs with a dual functionality: they not only learn to generate safer responses but can also provide an interpretable harmfulness classification to justify their refusal decisions. A significant advantage of this approach is its modularity; the VGM is designed as a plug-in component, allowing for seamless integration with diverse pre-trained VLMs across various scales. Experiments show that Safe-VLM with VGM, trained on our HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe-Bench itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing VLM models. We hope that HoliSafe and VGM will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe</p></details> |

This paper presents 3D-RAD, a large-scale dataset designed to advance 3D Med-VQA using radiology CT scans. The 3D-RAD dataset encompasses six diverse VQA tasks: anomaly detection, image observation, medical computation, existence detection, static temporal diagnosis, and longitudinal temporal diagnosis. It supports both open- and closed-ended questions while introducing complex reasoning challenges, including computational tasks and multi-stage temporal analysis, to enable comprehensive benchmarking. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that existing vision-language models (VLMs), especially medical VLMs exhibit limited generalization, particularly in multi-temporal tasks, underscoring the challenges of real-world 3D diagnostic reasoning.

However, SMB documents are often difficult to parse. They are rarely born digital and instead are distributed as scanned images that are none machine readable. The scans themselves are low in resolution, affected by skew or rotation, and often contain noisy backgrounds. These documents also tend to be heterogeneous, mixing narratives, tables, figures, and multilingual content within the same report. Such characteristics pose major challenges for automated information extraction, especially when relying on end to end large Vision Language Models, which are computationally expensive, sensitive to noise, and slow when applied to files with hundreds of pages. We propose a multistage pipeline that leverages traditional image processing models and OCR extraction, together with compact VLMs for structured field extraction of large-scale financial documents. Our approach begins with image pre-processing, including segmentation, orientation detection, and size normalization. Multilingual OCR is then applied to recover page-level text. Upon analyzing the text information, pages are retrieved for coherent sections. Finally, compact VLMs are operated within these narrowed-down scopes to extract structured financial indicators. Our approach is evaluated using an internal corpus of multi-lingual, scanned financial documents. The results demonstrate that compact VLMs, together with a multistage pipeline, achieves 8.8 times higher field level accuracy relative to directly feeding the whole document into large VLMs, only at 0.7 percent of the GPU cost and 92.6 percent less end-to-end service latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Language Models for Semantic Navigation and Manipulation in an Aerial-Ground Robotic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05020v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous multirobot systems show great potential in complex tasks requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, existing methods that rely on static or task-specific models often lack generalizability across diverse tasks and dynamic environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical multimodal framework that integrates a prompted large language model (LLM) with a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM). At the system level, the LLM performs hierarchical task decomposition and constructs a global semantic map, while the VLM provides semantic perception and object localization, where the proposed GridMask significantly enhances the VLM's spatial accuracy for reliable fine-grained manipulation. The aerial robot leverages this global map to generate semantic paths and guide the ground robot's local navigation and manipulation, ensuring robust coordination even in target-absent or ambiguous scenarios. We validate the framework through extensive simulation and real-world experiments on long-horizon object arrangement tasks, demonstrating zero-shot adaptability, robust semantic navigation, and reliable manipulation in dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first heterogeneous aerial-ground robotic system that integrates VLM-based perception with LLM-driven reasoning for global high-level task planning and execution.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases, and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in accuracy and speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>hi-re...</summary><p>hi-res paper and other details at: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/sil/projects/vomp</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on the final diagnostic answer, offering limited insight into whether models engage in clinically meaningful reasoning. To address this, we present CheXStruct and CXReasonBench, a structured pipeline and benchmark built on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. CheXStruct automatically derives a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps directly from chest X-rays, such as segmenting anatomical regions, deriving anatomical landmarks and diagnostic measurements, computing diagnostic indices, and applying clinical thresholds. CXReasonBench leverages this pipeline to evaluate whether models can perform clinically valid reasoning steps and to what extent they can learn from structured guidance, enabling fine-grained and transparent assessment of diagnostic reasoning. The benchmark comprises 18,988 QA pairs across 12 diagnostic tasks and 1,200 cases, each paired with up to 4 visual inputs, and supports multi-path, multi-stage evaluation including visual grounding via anatomical region selection and diagnostic measurements. Even the strongest of 12 evaluated LVLMs struggle with structured reasoning and generalization, often failing to link abstract knowledge with anatomically grounded visual interpretation.
